What potential does it have? What are its limits? Where does it come from? In this section we look at what data journalism is and what it might mean for news organizations. Paul Bradshaw (Birmingham City University) and Mirko Lorenz (Deutsche Welle) say a bit about what is distinctive about data journalism. Leading data journalists tell us why they think it is important and what their favorite examples are. Finally Liliana Bounegru (European Journalism Centre) puts data journalism into its broader historical context.</simpara><sect1 id="_what_is_data_journalism"><title>What Is Data Journalism?</title><simpara>What is data journalism? I could answer, simply, that it is journalism done with data. But that doesn’t help much.</simpara><simpara>Both “data” and “journalism” are troublesome terms. Some people think of “data” as any collection of numbers, most likely gathered on a spreadsheet. 20 years ago, that was pretty much the only sort of data that journalists dealt with. But we live in a digital world now, a world in which almost anything can be (and almost everything is) described with numbers.</simpara><simpara>Your career history, 300,000 confidential documents, everyone in your circle of friends; these can all be (and are) described with just two numbers: zeroes, and ones. Photos, video, and audio are all described with the same two numbers: zeroes and ones. Murders, disease, political votes, corruption, and lies: zeroes and ones.</simpara><simpara>What makes data journalism different to the rest of journalism? Perhaps it is the new possibilities that open up when you combine the traditional “nose for news” and ability to tell a compelling story with the sheer scale and range of digital information now available.</simpara><simpara>And those possibilities can come at any stage of the journalist’s process: using programming to automate the process of gathering and combining information from local government, police, and other civic sources, as Adrian Holovaty did with <ulink url="http://chicago.everyblock.com/crime/">ChicagoCrime</ulink> and then <ulink url="http://www.everyblock.com/">EveryBlock</ulink>.</simpara><simpara>Or using software to find connections between hundreds of thousands of documents, as The Telegraph did with MPs’ expenses (<ulink url="http://tgr.ph/mps-expenses">http://tgr.ph/mps-expenses</ulink>).</simpara><figure id="FIG012" float="0"><title>Investigate your MP’s expenses (the Guardian)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 1 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0101.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0101.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><simpara>Data journalism can help a journalist tell a complex story through engaging infographics. For example, Hans Rosling’s spectacular talks on visualizing world poverty with <ulink url="http://www.gapminder.org/">Gapminder</ulink> have attracted millions of views across the world. And David McCandless’ popular work in distilling big numbers—such as putting public spending into context, or the pollution generated and prevented by the Icelandic volcano—shows the importance of clear design at <ulink url="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/">Information is Beautiful</ulink>.</simpara><simpara>Or it can help explain how a story relates to an individual, as the BBC and the Financial Times now routinely do with their budget interactives (where you can find out how the budget affects you, rather than “Joe Public”). And it can open up the news-gathering process itself, as the Guardian does so successfully in sharing data, context, and questions with their <ulink url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog">Datablog</ulink>.</simpara><simpara>Data can be the source of data journalism, or it can be the tool with which the story is told—or it can be both. Like any source, it should be treated with skepticism; and like any tool, we should be conscious of how it can shape and restrict the stories that are created with it.</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>Paul Bradshaw, Birmingham City University</emphasis></simpara></sect1><sect1 id="_why_journalists_should_use_data"><title>Why Journalists Should Use Data</title><simpara>Journalism is under siege. In the past we, as an industry, relied on being the only ones operating a technology to multiply and distribute what had happened overnight. The printing press served as a gateway. If anybody wanted to reach the people of a city or region the next morning, they would turn to newspapers. This era is over.</simpara><simpara>Today, news stories are flowing in as they happen, from multiple sources, eyewitnesses, and blogs, and what has happened is filtered through a vast network of social connections, being ranked, commented on—and more often than not, ignored.</simpara><simpara>This is why data journalism is so important. Gathering, filtering, and visualizing what is happening beyond what the eye can see has a growing value. The orange juice you drink in the morning, the coffee you brew: in today’s global economy, there are invisible connections between these products, other people, and you. The language of this network is data: little points of information that are often not relevant in a single instance, but massively important when viewed from the right angle.</simpara><simpara>Right now, a few pioneering journalists already demonstrate how data can be used to create deeper insights into what is happening around us and how it might affect us.</simpara><simpara>Data analysis can reveal “a story’s shape” (Sarah Cohen), or provides us with a “new camera” (David McCandless). By using data, the job of journalists shifts its main focus from being the first ones to report to being the ones telling us what a certain development might actually mean. The range of topics can be wide. The next financial crisis that is in the making. The economics behind the products we use. The misuse of funds or political blunders, presented in a compelling data visualization that leaves little room to argue with it.</simpara><simpara>This is why journalists should see data as an opportunity. They can, for example, reveal how some abstract threat (such as unemployment) affects people based on their age, gender, or education. Using data transforms something abstract into something everyone can understand and relate to.</simpara><simpara>They can create personalized calculators to help people to make decisions, be this buying a car, a house, deciding on an education or professional path in life, or doing a hard check on costs to stay out of debt.</simpara><simpara>They can analyze the dynamics of a complex situation like a riot or political debate, show fallacies, and help everyone to see possible solutions to complex problems.</simpara><simpara>Becoming knowledgeable in searching, cleaning, and visualizing data is transformative for the profession of information gathering, too. Journalists who master this will experience that building articles on facts and insights is a relief. Less guessing, less looking for quotes; instead, a journalist can build a strong position supported by data, and this can affect the role of journalism greatly.</simpara><simpara>Additionally, getting into data journalism offers a future perspective. Today, when newsrooms downsize, most journalists hope to switch to public relations. Data journalists or data scientists, though, are already a sought-after group of employees, not only in the media. Companies and institutions around the world are looking for “sensemakers” and professionals who know how to dig through data and transform it into something tangible.</simpara><simpara>There is a promise in data, and this is what excites newsrooms, making them look for a new type of reporter. For freelancers, proficiency with data provides a route to new offerings and stable pay, too. Look at it this way: instead of hiring journalists to quickly fill pages and websites with low value content, the use of data could create demand for interactive packages, where spending a week on solving one question is the only way to do it. This is a welcome change in many parts of the media.</simpara><simpara>There is one barrier keeping journalists from using this potential: training themselves to work with data through all the steps—from a first question to a big data-driven scoop.</simpara><?dbfo-need height="2in"?><simpara>Working with data is like stepping into vast, unknown territory. At first look, raw data is puzzling to the eyes and to the mind. Such data is unwieldy. It is quite hard to shape it correctly for visualization. It needs experienced journalists, who have the stamina to look at often confusing or boring raw data and “see” the hidden stories in there.</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>Mirko Lorenz, Deutsche Welle</emphasis></simpara><sidebar><title>The Survey</title><simpara>The European Journalism Centre <ulink url="http://bit.ly/ddjnet-survey">conducted a survey</ulink> to find out more about training needs of journalists. We found there is a big willingness to get out of the comfort zone of traditional journalism and invest time in mastering new skills. The results from the survey showed us that journalists see the opportunity, but need a bit of support to cut through the initial problems that keep them from working with data. There is a confidence that should data journalism become more universally adopted, the workflows, tools, and results will improve quite quickly. Pioneers such as the Guardian, The New York Times, the Texas Tribune, and Die Zeit continue to raise the bar with their data-driven stories.</simpara><simpara>Will data journalism remain the preserve of a small handful of pioneers, or will every news organization soon have its own dedicated data journalism team?

As we grapple with the consumption challenges presented by this deluge of data, new publishing platforms are also empowering everyone to gather and share data digitally, turning it into information.

A good example of this is Steve Doig’s story that analyzed damage patterns from Hurricane Andrew.

Around that time, the term started to enter into more widespread usage (along with “computer-assisted reporting”) to describe how journalists were using data to improve their coverage and to augment in-depth investigations into a given topic.</simpara><?dbfo-need height="1in"?><simpara>Speaking to experienced data journalists and journalism scholars <ulink url="http://bit.ly/smfrogers-status">on Twitter</ulink> it seems that one of the earliest formulations of what we now recognize as data journalism was in 2006 by Adrian Holovaty, founder of EveryBlock, an information service that enables users to find out what has been happening in their area, on their block. In his short essay <ulink url="http://www.holovaty.com/writing/fundamental-change/">“A fundamental way newspaper sites need to change”</ulink>, he argues that journalists should publish structured, machine-readable data, alongside the traditional “big blob of text”:</simpara><blockquote><simpara>For example, say a newspaper has written a story about a local fire. Being able to read that story on a cell phone is fine and dandy. Hooray, technology! But what I really want to be able to do is explore the raw facts of that story, one by one, with layers of attribution, and an infrastructure for comparing the details of the fire with the details of previous fires: date, time, place, victims, fire station number, distance from fire department, names and years experience of firemen on the scene, time it took for firemen to arrive, and subsequent fires, whenever they happen.</simpara></blockquote><simpara>But what makes this distinctive from other forms of journalism that use databases or computers? How, and to what extent is data journalism different from other forms of journalism from the past?</simpara><sect2 id="_computer_assisted_reporting_and_precision_journalism"><title>Computer-Assisted Reporting and Precision Journalism</title><simpara>Using data to improve reportage and delivering structured (if not machine-readable) information to the public has a long history. Perhaps most immediately relevant to what we now call data journalism is <emphasis>computer-assisted reporting</emphasis>, or CAR, which was the first organized, systematic approach to using computers to collect and analyze data to improve the news.</simpara><simpara>CAR was first used in 1952 by CBS to predict the result of the presidential election. Since the 1960s, (mainly investigative, mainly US-based) journalists have sought to independently monitor power by analyzing databases of public records with scientific methods. Also known as “public service journalism,” advocates of these computer-assisted techniques have sought to reveal trends, debunk popular knowledge and reveal injustices perpetrated by public authorities and private corporations. For example, Philip Meyer tried to debunk received readings of the 1967 riots in Detroit to show that it was not just less educated Southerners who were participating. Bill Dedman’s “The Color of Money” stories in the 1980s revealed systemic racial bias in lending policies of major financial institutions. In his “What Went Wrong” article, Steve Doig sought to analyze the damage patterns from Hurricane Andrew in the early 1990s, to understand the effect of flawed urban development policies and practices. Data-driven reporting has brought valuable public service, and has won journalists famous prizes.</simpara><?dbfo-need height="1in"?><simpara>In the early 1970s the term <emphasis>precision journalism</emphasis> was coined to describe this type of news-gathering: “the application of social and behavioral science research methods to the practice of journalism” (from <emphasis>The New Precision Journalism</emphasis> by Philip Meyer; <ulink url="http://bit.ly/precision-journalism">http://bit.ly/precision-journalism</ulink>). Precision journalism was envisioned to be practiced in mainstream media institutions by professionals trained in journalism and social sciences. It was born in response to “new journalism,” a form of journalism in which fiction techniques were applied to reporting. Meyer suggests that scientific techniques of data collection and analysis, rather than literary techniques, are what is needed for journalism to accomplish its search for objectivity and truth.</simpara><simpara>Precision journalism can be understood as a reaction to some of journalism’s commonly cited inadequacies and weaknesses: dependence on press releases (later described as “churnalism”), bias towards authoritative sources, and so on. These are seen by Meyer as stemming from a lack of application of information science techniques and scientific methods such as polls and public records. As practiced in the 1960s, precision journalism was used to represent marginal groups and their stories. According to <ulink url="http://bit.ly/p-meyer">Meyer</ulink>:</simpara><blockquote><simpara>Precision journalism was a way to expand the tool kit of the reporter to make topics that were previously inaccessible, or only crudely accessible, subject to journalistic scrutiny. It was especially useful in giving a hearing to minority and dissident groups that were struggling for representation.</simpara></blockquote><simpara>An <ulink url="http://bit.ly/oxford-influential">influential article</ulink> published in the 1980s about the relationship between journalism and social science echoes current discourse around data journalism. The authors, two US journalism professors, suggest that in the 1970s and 1980s, the public’s understanding of what news is broadens from a narrower conception of “news events” to “situational reporting” (or reporting on social trends). For example, by using databases of census data or survey data, journalists are able to “move beyond the reporting of specific, isolated events to providing a context which gives them meaning.”</simpara><simpara>As we might expect, the practice of using data to improve reportage goes back as far as data has been around. As Simon Rogers <ulink url="http://bit.ly/facts-are-sacred">points out</ulink>, the first example of data journalism at the Guardian dates from 1821.

They say that CAR is a technique for gathering and analyzing data as a way of enhancing (usually investigative) reportage, whereas data journalism pays attention to the way that data sits within the whole journalistic workflow. In this sense data journalism pays as much—and sometimes more—attention to the data itself, rather than using data simply as a means to find or enhance stories. Hence we find the Guardian Datablog or the Texas Tribune publishing datasets alongside stories—or even just datasets by themselves—for people to analyze and explore.</simpara><simpara>Another difference is that in the past, investigative reporters would suffer from a poverty of information relating to a question they were trying to answer or an issue that they were trying to address. While this is of course still the case, there is also an overwhelming abundance of information that journalists don’t necessarily know what to do with. They don’t know how to get value out of data. A recent example is the Combined Online Information System, the UK’s biggest database of spending information. The database was long sought after by transparency advocates, but baffled and stumped many journalists upon its release. As Philip Meyer recently wrote to me: “When information was scarce, most of our efforts were devoted to hunting and gathering. Now that information is abundant, processing is more important.”</simpara><simpara>On the other hand, some argue that there is no meaningful difference between data journalism and computer-assisted reporting. It is by now common sense that even the most recent media practices have histories, as well as something new in them. Rather than debating whether or not data journalism is completely novel, a more fruitful position would be to consider it as part of a longer tradition, but responding to new circumstances and conditions. Even if there might not be a difference in goals and techniques, the emergence of the label “data journalism” at the beginning of the century indicates a new phase wherein the sheer volume of data that is freely available online—combined with sophisticated user-centric tools, self-publishing, and crowdsourcing tools—enables more people to work with more data more easily than ever before.</simpara></sect2><sect2 id="_data_journalism_is_about_mass_data_literacy"><title>Data Journalism Is About Mass Data Literacy</title><simpara>Digital technologies and the web are fundamentally changing the way information is published. Data journalism is one part in the ecosystem of tools and practices that have sprung up around data sites and services. Quoting and sharing source materials is in the nature of the hyperlink structure of the Web, and the way we are accustomed to navigating information today. Going further back, the principle that sits at the foundation of the hyperlinked structure of the Web is the citation principle used in academic works. Quoting and sharing the source materials and the data behind the story is one of the basic ways in which data journalism can improve journalism, what WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange calls “scientific journalism.”</simpara><simpara>By enabling anyone to drill down into data sources and find information that is relevant to them, as well as to to verify assertions and challenge commonly received assumptions, data journalism effectively represents the mass democratization of resources, tools, techniques, and methodologies that were previously used by specialists; whether investigative reporters, social scientists, statisticians, analysts, or other experts. While currently quoting and linking to data sources is particular to data journalism, we are moving towards a world in which data is seamlessly integrated into the fabric of media. Data journalists have an important role in helping to lower the barriers to understanding and delving into data, and increasing the data literacy of their readers on a mass scale.</simpara><simpara>At the moment the nascent community of people who call themselves data journalists is largely distinct from the more mature CAR community. Hopefully in the future, we will see stronger ties between these two communities, in much the same way that we see new NGOs and citizen media organizations like ProPublica and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism work hand in hand with traditional news media on investigations. While the data journalism community might have more innovative ways to deliver data and present stories, the deeply analytical and critical approach of the CAR community is something that data journalism could certainly learn from.</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>Liliana Bounegru, European Journalism Centre</emphasis></simpara></sect2></sect1></chapter><chapter id="_in_the_newsroom"><title>In The Newsroom</title><informalfigure role="informal" float="0"><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_02in01.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_02in01.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></informalfigure><simpara>How does data journalism sit within newsrooms around the world? How did leading data journalists convince their colleagues that it is a good idea to publish datasets or launch data-driven news apps? Should journalists learn how to code, or work in tandem with talented developers? In this section we look at the role of data and data journalism at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the BBC, the Chicago Tribune, the Guardian, the Texas Tribune, and the Zeit Online. We learn how to spot and hire good developers, how to engage people around a topic through hackathons and other events, how to collaborate across borders, and business models for data journalism.</simpara><sect1 id="_the_abc_8217_s_data_journalism_play"><title>The ABC’s Data Journalism Play</title><simpara>The Australian Broadcasting Corporation is Australia’s national public broadcaster. Annual funding is around $1 billion dollars (AUS), which delivers seven radio networks, 60 local radio stations, three digital television services, a new international television service, and an online platform to deliver this ever-expanding offering of digital and user-generated content. At last count, there were over 4,500 full time equivalent staff, and nearly 70% of them make content.</simpara><simpara>We are a national broadcaster fiercely proud of our independence; although funded by the government, we are separated at arm’s length through law. Our traditions are independent public service journalism. The ABC is regarded as the most trusted news organization in the country.</simpara><simpara>These are exciting times; under a managing director (the former newspaper executive Mark Scott), content makers at the ABC have been encouraged to be “agile,” as the corporate mantra puts it.</simpara><simpara>Of course, that’s easier said than done.</simpara><simpara>But one initiative in recent times designed to encourage this has been  a competitive staff pitch for money to develop multiplatform projects.</simpara><simpara>This is how the ABC’s first ever data journalism project was conceived.</simpara><simpara>Sometime early in 2010, I wandered into the pitch session to face three senior “ideas” people with my proposal.</simpara><simpara>I’d been chewing it over for some time, greedily lapping up the data journalism that the now legendary Guardian Datablog was offering, and that was just for starters.</simpara><simpara>It was my argument that no doubt within 5 years, the ABC would have its own data journalism unit. It was inevitable, I opined. But the question was how we would get there, and who was going to start.</simpara><simpara>For those readers unfamiliar with the ABC, think of a vast bureaucracy built up over 70 years. Its primary offering was always radio and television. With the advent of a website, in the last decade this content offering unfurled into text, stills, and a degree of interactivity previously unimagined. The web space was forcing the ABC to rethink how it cut the cake (money) and what kind of cake it was baking (content).</simpara><simpara>It is of course a work in progress.</simpara><simpara>But something else was happening with data journalism. Government 2.0 (which as we discovered, is largely observed in the breach in Australia) was starting to offer new ways of telling stories that were hitherto buried in the zeros and ones.</simpara><simpara>I said all of this to the folks attending my pitch. I also said that we needed to identify new skill sets and train journalists in new tools.

My hunch is that there are a lot of geeks and hackers hiding in media technical departments desperate to get out. So we need “hack and hacker meets” workshops where the secret geeks, younger journalists, web developers, and designers come out to play with more experienced journalists for skill-sharing and mentoring. Task: download this dataset and go for it!</simpara><simpara>Ipso facto, data journalism is interdisciplinary. Data journalism teams are made of people who would not have worked together in the past. The digital space has blurred the boundaries.</simpara><simpara>We live in a fractured, distrustful body politic. The business model that formerly delivered professional independent journalism—imperfect as it is—is on the verge of collapse. We ought to ask ourselves, as many now are, what might the world look like without a viable fourth estate? The American journalist and intellectual Walter Lippman remarked in the 1920’s that “it is admitted that a sound public opinion cannot exist without access to news.” That statement is no less true now. In the 21st century, everyone’s hanging out in the blogosphere. It’s hard to tell the spinners, liars, dissemblers, and vested interest groups from the professional journalists. Pretty much any site or source can be made to look credible, slick, and honest. The trustworthy mastheads are dying in the ditch. And in this new space of junk journalism, hyperlinks can endlessly take the reader to other more useless but brilliant-looking sources that keep hyperlinking back into the digital hall of mirrors. The technical term for this is: bullshit baffles brains.</simpara><simpara>In the digital space, everyone’s a storyteller now, right? Wrong. If professional journalism—and by that I mean those who embrace ethical, balanced, courageous truth-seeking storytelling—is to survive, then the craft must reassert itself in the digital space. Data journalism is just another tool by which we will navigate the digital space. It’s where we will map, flip, sort, filter, extract, and see the story amidst all those zeros and ones. In the future we’ll be working side by side with the hackers, the developers, the designers, and the coders. It’s a transition that requires serious capacity building. We need news managers who “get” the digital/journalism connection to start investing in the build.</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>Wendy Carlisle, Australian Broadcasting Corporation</emphasis></simpara></sect2></sect1><sect1 id="_data_journalism_at_the_bbc"><title>Data Journalism at the BBC</title><simpara>The term “data journalism” can cover a range of disciplines and is used in varying ways in news organizations, so it may be helpful to define what we mean by “data journalism” at the BBC.

Readers can find local schools by entering a postcode, and compare them on a range of indicators. Education journalists also work with the development team to trawl the data for stories ahead of publication.</simpara><simpara>When we started to do this, there was no official site that provided a way for the public to explore the data. But now that the Department for Education has its own comparable service, our offering has shifted to focus more on the stories that emerge from the data.</simpara><simpara>The challenge in this area must be to provide access to data in which there is a clear public interest. A recent example of a project where we exposed a large dataset not normally available to the wider public was the special report <ulink url="http://bbc.in/road-deaths">“Every death on every road”</ulink>. We provided a postcode search, allowing users to find the location of all road fatalities in the UK in the past decade.</simpara><simpara>We <ulink url="http://bbc.in/police-data">visualized some of the main facts and figures</ulink> that emerge from the police data and, to give the project a more dynamic feel and a human face, we teamed up with the London Ambulance Association and BBC London radio and TV to track crashes across the capital as they happened. This was reported <ulink url="http://bbc.in/road-deaths-feed">live online</ulink>, as well as via Twitter using the hashtag #crash24, and collisions were <ulink url="http://bbc.in/road-deaths-map">mapped</ulink> as they were reported.</simpara></sect2><sect2 id="_simple_tools"><title>Simple Tools</title><simpara>As well as providing ways to explore large datasets, we have also had success creating simple tools for users that provide personally relevant snippets of information. These tools appeal to the time-poor, who may not choose to explore lengthy analysis. The ability to easily share a personal fact is something we have begun to incorporate as standard.</simpara><simpara>A lighthearted example of this approach is our feature <ulink url="http://bbc.in/KQsSzB">“The world at 7 billion: What’s your number?”</ulink>, published to coincide with the official date at which the world’s population exceeded 7 billion. By entering their birth date, the user could find out what “number” they were, in terms of the global population, when they were born and then share that number via Twitter or Facebook. The application used data provided by the UN population development fund. It was very popular, and became the most shared link on Facebook in the UK in 2011.</simpara><figure id="FIG024" float="none"><title>The world at seven billion (BBC)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 3 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0203.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0203.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><simpara>Another recent example is the BBC <ulink url="http://bbc.in/JepssY">budget calculator</ulink>, which enabled users to find out how better or worse off they will be when the Chancellor’s budget takes effect—and then share that figure.

Finding stories in data is a more traditional definition of data journalism. Is there an exclusive buried in the database? Are the figures accurate? Do they prove or disprove a problem? These are all questions a data journalist or computer-assisted reporter must ask themselves. But a great deal of time can be taken up sifting through a massive dataset in the hope of finding something remarkable.</simpara><simpara>In this area, we have found it most productive to partner with investigative teams or programs that have the expertise and time to investigate a story. The BBC current affairs program Panorama spent months working with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, gathering data on public sector pay. The result was a TV documentary and a special report online, <ulink url="http://bbc.in/IKPrL2">“Public Sector pay: The numbers”</ulink>, where all the data was published and visualized with sector by sector analysis.</simpara><simpara>As well as partnering with investigative journalists, having access to numerous journalists with specialist knowledge is essential. When a business colleague on the team analyzed the spending review cuts data put out by the government, he came to the conclusion that it was making them sound bigger than they actually were. The result was an exclusive story, <ulink url="http://bbc.in/LcuGFV">“Making sense of the data”</ulink> complemented by a <ulink url="http://bbc.in/IIADrj">clear visualization</ulink>, which won a Royal Statistical Society award.</simpara></sect2><sect2 id="_understanding_an_issue"><title>Understanding An Issue</title><simpara>But data journalism doesn’t have to be an exclusive no one else has spotted. The job of the data visualization team is to combine great design with a clear editorial narrative to provide a compelling experience for the user. Engaging visualizations of the right data can be used to give a better understanding of an issue or story, and we frequently use this approach in our storytelling at the BBC. One technique used in our UK claimant count tracker is to heat-map data over time to give a clear view of change (<ulink url="http://bbc.in/KF7IKU">http://bbc.in/KF7IKU</ulink>).</simpara><simpara>The data feature <ulink url="http://bbc.in/IIAHHI">“Eurozone debt web”</ulink> explores the tangled web of intra-country lending.

We work closely with editors and reporters to help: 1) research and report stories, 2) illustrate stories online and 3) build evergreen web resources for the fine people of Chicagoland.</simpara><simpara>It’s important that we sit in the newsroom. We usually find work via face-to-face conversations with reporters. They know that we’re happy to help write a screen scraper for a crummy government website, tear up a stack of PDFs, or otherwise turn non-data into something you can analyze. It’s sort of our team’s loss leader; this way we find out about potential data projects at the outset.</simpara><simpara>Unlike many teams in this field, our team was founded by technologists for whom journalism was a career change. Some of us acquired a masters degree in journalism after several years of coding for business purposes, and others were borrowed from the open government community.</simpara><simpara>We work in an agile fashion. To make sure we’re always in sync, every morning begins with a 5-minute stand-up meeting. We frequently program in pairs; two developers at one keyboard are often more productive than two developers at two keyboards. Most projects don’t take more than a week to produce, but on longer projects we work in week-long iterations, and show our work to stakeholders (reporters and editors usually) every week. “Fail fast” is the mantra. If you’re doing it wrong, you need to know as soon as possible, especially when you’re coding on a deadline!</simpara><simpara>There’s a tremendous upside to hacking iteratively, on a deadline: we’re always updating our toolkit. Every week we crank out an app or two, then, unlike normal software shops, we can put it to the back of our mind and move on to the next project.

We help reporters dig through data, turn PDFs back into spreadsheets, screen-scrape websites, etc. It’s a service that we like to provide because it gets us in early on the data work that’s happening in the newsroom. Some of that work becomes a news application: a map, table, or sometimes a larger-scale website.</simpara><simpara>Before, we linked to the app from the written story, which didn’t result in much traffic.

We’ve had newspapers devoting valuable column inches to the release of the Treasury’s COINS database.</simpara><simpara>At the same time, as the Web pumps out more and more data, readers from around the world are more interested in the raw facts behind the news than ever before. When we launched the Datablog, we thought the audiences would be developers building applications. In fact, it’s people wanting to know more about carbon emissions, Eastern European immigration, the breakdown of deaths in Afghanistan, or even the number of times the Beatles used the word “love” in their songs (613).</simpara><figure id="FIG026" float="none"><title>The Guardian Datablog production process visualized (the Guardian)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 5 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0205.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0205.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><?dbfo-need height="1in"?><simpara>Gradually, the Datablog’s work has reflected and added to the stories we faced. We crowdsourced 458,000 documents relating to MPs’ expenses and we analyzed the detailed data of which MPs had claimed what. We helped our users explore detailed Treasury spending databases and published the data behind the news.</simpara><simpara>But the game-changer for data journalism happened in spring 2010, beginning with one spreadsheet: 92,201 rows of data, each one containing a detailed breakdown of a military event in Afghanistan. This was the WikiLeaks war logs. Part one, that is. There were to be two more episodes to follow: Iraq and the cables. The official term for the first two parts was SIGACTS: the US military Significant Actions Database.</simpara><simpara>News organizations are all about geography—and proximity to the news desk. If you’re close, it’s easy to suggest stories and become part of the process; conversely, out of sight is literally out of mind. Before WikiLeaks, we were placed on a different floor, with graphics. Since WikiLeaks, we have sat on the same floor, next to the newsdesk. It means that it’s easier for us to suggest ideas to the desk, and for reporters across the newsroom to think of us to help with stories.</simpara><simpara>It’s not that long ago journalists were the gatekeepers to official data. We would write stories about the numbers and release them to a grateful public, who were not interested in the raw statistics. The idea of us allowing raw information into our newspapers was anathema.</simpara><simpara>Now that dynamic has changed beyond recognition. Our role is becoming interpreters; helping people understand the data, and even just publishing it because it’s interesting in itself.</simpara><simpara>But numbers without analysis are just numbers, which is where we fit in. When Britain’s prime minister claims the riots in August 2011 were not about poverty, we were able to map the addresses of the rioters with poverty indicators to show the truth behind the claim.</simpara><simpara>Behind all of our data journalism stories is a process. It’s changing all the time as we use new tools and techniques. Some people say the answer is to become a sort of super hacker, write code, and immerse yourself in SQL. You can decide to take that approach. But a lot of the work we do is just in Excel.</simpara><simpara>Firstly, we locate the data or receive it from a variety of sources, from breaking news stories, government data, journalists’ research and so on. We then start looking at what we can do with the data; do we need to mash it up with another dataset? How can we show changes over time? Those spreadsheets often have to be seriously tidied up—all those extraneous columns and weirdly merged cells really don’t help. And that’s assuming it’s not a PDF, the worst format for data known to humankind.</simpara><simpara>Often official data comes with the official codes added in; each school, hospital, constituency, and local authority has a unique identifier code.</simpara><?dbfo-need height="1in"?><simpara>Countries have them too (the UK’s code is GB, for instance). They’re useful because you may want to start mashing datasets together, and it’s amazing how many different spellings and word arrangements can get in the way of that. There’s Burma and Myanmar, for instance, or Fayette County in the US (there are 11 of these in states from Georgia to West Virginia). Codes allow us to compare like with like.</simpara><simpara>At the end of that process is the output: will it be a story or a graphic or a visualization, and what tools will we use? Our top tools are the free ones that we can produce something quickly with. The more sophisticated graphics are produced by our dev team.</simpara><simpara>This means that we commonly use Google charts for small line graphs and pies, or Google Fusion Tables to create maps quickly and easily.</simpara><simpara>It may seem new, but it’s really not.</simpara><simpara>In the very first issue of the Manchester Guardian (on Saturday May 5th, 1821), the news was on the back page, like all papers of the day. The first item on the front page was an ad for a missing Labrador.</simpara><simpara>Amid the stories and poetry excerpts, a third of that back page is taken up with, well, facts. A comprehensive table of the costs of schools in the area never before “laid before the public,” writes “NH.”</simpara><simpara>NH wanted his data published because otherwise the facts would be left to untrained clergymen to report. His motivation was that, “Such information as it contains is valuable; because, without knowing the extent to which education … prevails, the best opinions which can be formed of the condition and future progress of society must be necessarily incorrect.” In other words, if the people don’t know what’s going on, how can society get any better?</simpara><simpara>I can’t think of a better rationale now for what we’re trying to do. Now what once was a back page story can now make front page news.</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>Simon Rogers, the Guardian</emphasis></simpara></sect1><sect1 id="_data_journalism_at_the_zeit_online"><title>Data Journalism at the Zeit Online</title><simpara>The <ulink url="http://bit.ly/Pisa_Wealth">PISA based Wealth Comparison</ulink> project is an interactive visualization that enables comparison of standards of living in different countries. It uses data from the OECD’s comprehensive world education ranking report, <ulink url="http://bit.ly/Pisa_2009">PISA 2009</ulink>, published in December 2010. The report is based on a questionnaire which asks fifteen year-old pupils about their living situation at home.</simpara><simpara>The idea was to analyze and visualize this data to provide a unique way of comparing standards of living in different countries.</simpara><figure id="FIG027" float="none"><title>PISA based Wealth Comparison (Zeit Online)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 6 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0206.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0206.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><simpara>First, our in-house editorial team decided which facts seemed to be useful to make living standards comparable and should be visualized, including:</simpara><itemizedlist><listitem><simpara>
Wealth (number of TVs, cars and available bathrooms at home)
</simpara></listitem><listitem><simpara>
Family situation (whether there are grandparents living with the family, percentage share of families with only one child, unemployment of parents, and mother’s job status)
</simpara></listitem><listitem><simpara>
Access to knowledge sources (Internet at home, frequency of using email and quantity of owned books)
</simpara></listitem><listitem><simpara>
Three additional indicators on the level of development of each country
</simpara></listitem></itemizedlist><simpara>With the help of the internal design team, these facts were translated into self-explanatory icons. A front end design was built to make comparison between the different countries possible, by looking at them like they were playing cards.</simpara><simpara>Next we contacted people from the German <ulink url="http://opendata-network.org/">Open Data Network</ulink> to find developers who could help with the project. This community of highly motivated people suggested Gregor Aisch, a very talented information designer, to code the application that would make our dreams come true (without using Flash, which was very important to us!). Gregor created a very high quality and interactive visualization with a beautiful bubble-style, based on the <ulink url="http://raphaeljs.com/">Raphaël-Javascript Library</ulink>.</simpara><simpara>The result of our collaboration was a very successful interactive that got a lot of traffic. It is easy to compare any two countries, which makes it useful as a reference tool. This means that we can reuse it in our daily editorial work. For example, if we are covering something related to the living situation in Indonesia, we can quickly and easily embed a graphic <ulink url="http://bit.ly/Pisa_Indonesia_Germany">comparing the living situation in Indonesia and Germany</ulink>. The know-how transferred to our in-house team was a great investment for future projects.</simpara><simpara>At the Zeit Online, we’ve found that <ulink url="http://www.zeit.de/datenjournalismus">our data journalism projects</ulink> have brought us a lot of traffic and have helped us to engage audiences in new ways. For example, there was a lot of coverage about the situation at the nuclear plant in Fukushima after the tsunami in Japan. After radioactive material escaped from the power plant, everyone within 30 kilometers of the plant was evacuated. People could read and see a lot about the evacuations. Zeit Online found a innovative way to explain the impact of this to our German audience. We asked: how many people live near a nuclear power plant in Germany? How many people live within a radius of 30 kilometers? A map shows <ulink url="http://bit.ly/near_nuclear">how many people would have to be evacuated in a similar situation in Germany</ulink>. The result: lots and lots of traffic; in fact, the project went viral in the social media sphere. Data journalism projects can be relatively easily adapted to other languages. We created an English language version about proximity to nuclear power plants in the US, which was a great traffic motor. News organizations want to be recognized as trusted and authoritative sources amongst their readers.  We find that data journalism projects combined with enabling our readers to look and reuse the raw data brings us a high degree of credibility.</simpara><simpara>For two years the R&amp;D Department and the Editor-in-Chief at the Zeit Online, Wolfgang Blau, have been advocating data journalism as an important way to tell stories. Transparency, credibility, and user engagement are important parts of our philosophy. That is why data journalism is a natural part of our current and future work. Data visualizations can bring value to the reception of a story, and are an attractive way for the whole editorial team to present their content.</simpara><simpara>For example, on November 9th, 2011, Deutsche Bank pledged to stop financing cluster bomb manufacturers. But according to a study by non-profit organization Facing Finance, the bank continued to approve loans to producers of cluster munitions after that promise was made. <ulink url="http://zeit.de/wirtschaft/cluster-munition">Our visualization</ulink> based on the data shows our readers the various flows of money. The different parts of the Deutsche Bank company are arranged at the top, with the companies accused of involvement in building cluster munitions at the bottom. In between, the individual loans are represented along a timeline. Rolling over the circles shows the details of each transaction. Of course the story could have been told as a written article.

The same data visualized in a traditional population pyramid gives only a very abstract feeling of the situation, but a group with kids, younger people, adults, and elderly people means our readers can relate to the data more easily.

From the perspective of developers, journalists think outside the box to use data tools in contexts developers haven’t always considered before (feedback is invaluable!). They also help to build context and buzz around projects and help to make them relevant. It is a symbiotic relationship.</simpara><simpara>Fortunately, this means that whether you are looking to hire a hacker or looking for possible collaborations on a shoestring budget, there will more than likely be someone out there who is interested in helping you.</simpara><simpara>So how do you find them? Says Aron Pilhofer from The New York Times:</simpara><blockquote><simpara>You may find that your organzation already has people with all the skills you need, but they are not necessarily already in your newsroom.

Hiring well is extremely important. Unfortunately, hiring well is also very difficult. It’s hard enough to vet candidates if you are not an experienced technical manager. Add to that the salaries that news organizations can afford to pay, and you’ve got quite a challenge.</simpara><simpara>At Tribune, we recruit with two angles: an emotional appeal and a technical appeal. The emotional appeal is this: journalism is essential to a functioning democracy. Work here and you can change the world. Technically, we promote how much you’ll learn. Our projects are small, fast, and iterative. Every project is a new set of tools, a new language, a new topic (fire safety, the pension system), that you must learn. The newsroom is a crucible. I’ve never managed a team that has learned so much, so fast, as our team.</simpara><simpara>As for where to look, we’ve had great luck finding great hackers in the open government community. The Sunlight Labs mailing list is where do-gooder nerds with crappy day jobs hang out at night. Another potential resource is Code for America. Every year, a group of fellows emerges from CfA, looking for their next big project. And as a bonus, CfA has a rigorous interview process; they’ve already done the vetting for you. Nowadays, programming-interested journalists are also emerging from journalism schools. They’re green, but they’ve got tons of potential.</simpara><simpara>Lastly, it’s not enough to just hire developers. You need technical management. A lone-gun developer (especially fresh from journalism school, with no industry experience) is going to make many bad decisions. Even the best programmer, when left to her own devices, will choose technically interesting work over doing what’s most important to your audience.</simpara><simpara>Call this hire a news applications editor, a project manager, whatever.

Find stories

  For us, data journalism is something new and unknown. The only way we can prove its use is through well crafted stories. We planned to produce at least three data stories.

Host a social event
</term><listitem><simpara>
  Newspapers don’t organize a lot of social events, let alone hackathons. We wanted to experience how such an event can yield results. In fact, the event could have been tense: 30 hours with strangers, lots of jargon, bashing your head against basic questions, and working out of your comfort zone. By making it a social event (remember the pizza and energy drinks?), we wanted to create an environment in which journalists and programmers could feel comfortable and collaborate effectively.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry></variablelist><simpara>Before the event, TC Tubantia had an interview with the widow of a policeman who had written a book on her husband’s working years. She also had a document with all registered murders in the eastern part of the Netherlands, maintained by her husband since 1945. Normally, we would publish this document on our website. This time, we made a <ulink url="http://bit.ly/tableau-dashboard">dashboard using the Tableau software</ulink>. We also <ulink url="http://bit.ly/regiohack-blog">blogged</ulink> about how this came together on our RegioHack site.</simpara><simpara>During the hackathon, one project group came up with the subject of development of schools and the aging of our region. <ulink url="http://bit.ly/tableau-workbook">By making a visualization of future projections</ulink>, we understood which cities would get in trouble after a few years of decline in enrollments.

Through a Google-ish calculation—who has the most ties with powerful organizations—a list of influential people will be composed. This could lead to a series of articles, but it’s also a powerful tool for journalists. Who has connections with who? You can ask questions to this database and use it in your daily routine. Also, this database has cultural value.

We learned a lot, but we also came along a lot of obstacles. We recognized these four:</simpara><variablelist><varlistentry><term>
Where to begin: question or data?
</term><listitem><simpara>
  Almost all projects stalled when searching for information. Most of the time, they began with a journalistic question. But then? What data is available? Where can you find it? And when you find this data, can you answer your question with it? Journalists usually know where they can find information when doing research for an article. With data journalism, most journalists don’t know what information is available.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
Little technical knowledge
</term><listitem><simpara>
  Data journalism is quite a technical discipline. Sometimes you have to scrape, other times you’ll have to do some programming to visualize your results. For excellent data journalism, you’ll need two aspects: the journalistic insight of an experienced journalist and the technical know-how of a digital all-rounder. During RegioHack, this was not a common presence.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
Is it news?
</term><listitem><simpara>
  Participants mostly used one dataset to discover news, instead of searching interconnections between different sources. The reason for this is that you need some statistical knowledge to verify news from data journalism.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
What’s the routine?
</term><listitem><simpara>
  What everything above comes down to is that there’s no routine. The participants have some skills under their belt, but don’t know how and when to use them. One journalist compared it with baking a cake. “We have all the ingredients: flour, eggs, milk, etcetera. Now we throw it all in a bag, shake it, and hope a cake comes out.” Indeed, we have all the ingredients, but don’t know what the recipe is.

We found it fun, educational, and productive and a great introduction to data journalism.</simpara><simpara>But for data journalism to work, we have to integrate it in the newsroom. Journalists have to think in data, in addition to quotes, press releases, council meetings, and so on. By doing RegioHack, we proved to our audience that data journalism isn’t just hype.

However, at the same time, corrupt officials in governments and organized crime groups are doing their best to conceal information in order to hide their misdeeds. They make efforts to keep people in the dark while conducting ugly deals that cause disruptions at all society levels and lead to conflict, famine, or other crises.</simpara><simpara>It is the duty of investigative journalists to expose such wrongdoings, and by doing so, disable corrupt and criminal mechanisms.</simpara><figure id="FIG0214" float="0"><title>The Investigative Dashboard (OCCRP)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 12 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0212.pdf" format="PDF" scale="92"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0212.png" format="PNG" scale="92"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><simpara>There are three main guidelines that, if followed, can lead to good, thorough journalism when investigating major acts of corruption and crime even in the most austere of environments:</simpara><variablelist><varlistentry><term>
Think outside your country
</term><listitem><simpara>
  In many instances, it is much easier to get information from abroad than from within the country where the investigative journalist operates. Information gathered from abroad via foreign information databases or by using other countries’ access to information laws might be just what you need to put the investigative puzzle together. On top of that, criminals and corrupt officials don’t keep their money in the place they have stolen it from. They would rather deposit it in foreign banks or invest in other countries. Crime is global. Databases that assist the investigative journalist in tracking the money worldwide can be found in many places on the Internet. For example, the <ulink url="http://www.investigativedashboard.org/category/wwd/">Investigative Dashboard</ulink> enables journalists to follow the money across borders.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
Make use of existing investigative journalism networks
</term><listitem><simpara>
  Investigative journalists all over the world are grouped in
organzations such as <ulink url="http://www.reportingproject.net/">The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project</ulink>, <ulink url="http://www.fairreporters.org/">The African Forum for Investigative
Reporting</ulink>, <ulink url="http://arij.net/">The Arab Reporters for Investigative
Journalism</ulink>, and <ulink url="http://www.gijn.org/">The Global investigative Journalism Network</ulink>. Journalists can also make use of professional journalism platforms such as IJNet, where global journalism related information is exchanged on a daily basis. Many of the reporters grouped in networks work on similar issues and confront similar situations, so it makes a lot of sense to exchange information and methods. Emailing lists or social network groups are attached to these networks, so it is quite easy to get in touch with fellow journalists and to ask for information or advice. Investigative story ideas can also be gathered from such forums and emailing lists.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
Make use of technology and collaborate with hackers
</term><listitem><simpara>
  Software helps investigative journalists access and process information. Various types of software assist the investigator in cutting through the noise, in digging and making sense of large volumes of data, and in finding the right documents needed to break the story. There are many ready-made software programs that can be used as tools for analyzing, gathering, or interpreting information—and more importantly, investigative journalists need to be aware that there are scores of computer programmers ready to help if asked. These programmers or hackers know how to obtain and handle information, and they can assist a great deal with the investigative effort. These programmers, some of them members of global open data movements, can become invaluable allies in the fight against crime and corruption, able to assist journalists in gathering and analyzing information.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry></variablelist><simpara>A good example of an interface between programmers and citizens is <ulink url="https://scraperwiki.com/">ScraperWiki</ulink>, a site where journalists
can ask programmers for help with extracting data from websites. Investigative Dashboard <ulink url="http://bit.ly/dashboard-resources">maintains a list of ready-made tools</ulink> that could help journalists gather, shape, and analyze data.</simpara><simpara>The usefulness of the aforementioned guidelines has been visible in many instances. One good example is the work of Khadija Ismayilova, a very experienced Azeri investigative reporter who works in an austere environment when it comes to information access. Ms. Ismayilova has to overcome obstacles on a daily basis in order to offer the Azeri public good and reliable information. In June of 2011, Khadija Ismayilova, an investigative reporter with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s (RFE/RL) Baku-based office reported that the daughters of the Azeri president, Ilham Aliyev, secretly run <ulink url="http://bit.ly/rferl-azerfon">a fast-rising telecom company, Azerfon</ulink> through offshore companies based in Panama. The company boasts nearly 1.7 million subscribers, covers 80 percent of the country’s territory, and was (at the time) Azerbaijan’s only provider of 3G services. Ismayilova spent three years trying to find out who the owners of the telecom company were, but the government refused to disclose shareholder information and lied numerous times about the company’s ownership. They even claimed that the company was owned by the Germany-based Siemens AG, a claim that has been flatly denied by that corporation. The Azeri reporter managed to find out that Azerfon was owned by a few Panama-based private companies. This seemed to be a dead end to her reporting until she got help from outside. In early 2011, Ms. Ismayilova learned through the Investigative Dashboard that Panama-based companies can be tracked down through <ulink url="http://ohuiginn.net/panama/">an application</ulink> developed by programmer and activist Dan O’Huiginn. With this tool, she finally managed to uncover the fact that the president’s two daughters were involved with the telecom company through the Panama-based businesses.</simpara><simpara>In fact, O’Huiginn created a tool that helped journalists from all over the world to report on corruption—Panama, a very well-known offshore haven, has been widely used by several corrupt officials as a place to hide stolen money (from cronies of the former Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak to dirty officials in the Balkans or in Latin America). What the programmer-activist has done is called web scraping; a method that allows the extraction and reshaping of information so that it can be used by investigators. O’Huiginn scraped the <ulink url="http://www.registro-publico.gob.pa/">Panama registry of companies</ulink> because this registry, although open, only allowed searches if the investigative reporter knew the name of the commercial company he or she was looking for. This limited the possibilities of investigation, as reporters usually look for names of persons in order to track down their assets. He extracted the data and created a new website where name-based searches are also possible. The new website allowed investigative reporters in many countries to fish for information, to run names of officials in governments and Parliaments, and to check if they secretly owned corporations in Panama (just as the family of the Azerbaijan president did).</simpara><simpara>There are other advantages to using the guidelines highlighted above, besides better access to information. One of them has to do with minimizing harm and ensuring better protection for investigative reporters who work in hostile environments. This is due to the fact that when working in a network, the journalist is not alone; the investigative reporter works with colleagues in other countries, so it is harder for criminals to <phrase role="keep-together">pinpoint</phrase> who is responsible for their wrongdoings being exposed. As a result, retaliation by governments and corrupt officials is much harder to achieve.</simpara><simpara>Another thing to keep in mind is that information that doesn’t seem very valuable in a geographical area might be crucially important in another. The exchange of information over investigative networks can lead to breaking very important stories. For example, the information that a Romanian was caught in Colombia with 1 kilogram of cocaine is most probably not front page news in Bogota, but could be very important to the Romanian public if a local reporter manages to find out that the person who was caught with the narcotics is working for the government in Bucharest.</simpara><simpara>Efficient investigative reporting is the result of cooperation between investigative journalists, programmers, and others who want to use data to contribute to create a cleaner, fairer, and more just global society.</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>Paul Radu, Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project</emphasis></simpara></sect1><sect1 id="_our_stories_come_as_code"><title>Our Stories Come As Code</title><simpara><ulink url="http://www.opendatacity.de/">OpenDataCity</ulink> was founded towards the end of 2010. There was pretty much nothing that you could call data journalism happening in Germany at this time.</simpara><simpara>Why did we do this? Many times we heard people working for newspapers and broadcasters say: “No, we are not ready to start a dedicated data journalism unit in our newsroom. But we would be happy to outsource this to someone else.”</simpara><simpara>As far as we know, we are the only company specializing exclusively in data journalism in Germany. There are currently three of us: two of us with a journalism background and one with a deep understanding of code and visualization. We work with a handful of freelance hackers, designers, and journalists.</simpara><simpara>In the last twelve months we have undertaken four data journalism projects with newspapers, and have offered training and consultancy to media workers, scientists, and journalism schools. The first app we did was TAZ, an <ulink url="http://bit.ly/taz-airport-noise">interactive tool on airport noise</ulink> around the the newly built airport in Berlin. Our next notable project was an <ulink url="http://bit.ly/zeit-telephone">application about data retention</ulink> of the mobile phone usage of a German politician with ZEIT Online.

But when we talk to the publishers, who have to approve the projects, our argument for investing into data journalism is not about winning prizes. Rather it is about getting attention over a longer period of time in a sustainable way. That is, building things for their long term impact, not for the scoop, which is often forgotten after a few days.</simpara><simpara>Here are three arguments that we have used to encourage publishers to undertake longer term projects:</simpara><?dbfo-need height="1in"?><variablelist><varlistentry><term>
Data projects don’t date
</term><listitem><simpara>
  Depending on their design, new material can be added to data journalism apps. And they are not just for the users, but can be used internally for reporting and analysis. If you’re worried that this means that your competitors will also benefit from your investment, you could keep some features or some data for internal use only.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
You can build on your past work
</term><listitem><simpara>
  When undertaking a data project, you will often create bits of code that can be reused or updated. The next project might take half the time, because you know much better what to do (and what not to), and you have bits and pieces you can build on.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
Data journalism pays for itself
</term><listitem><simpara>
  Data-driven projects are cheaper than traditional marketing campaigns. Online news outlets will often invest in things like Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Search Engine Marketing (SEM). A executed data project will normally generate a lot of clicks and buzz, and may go viral. Publishers will typically pay less for this than trying to generate the same attention by clicks and links through SEM.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry></variablelist><simpara>Our work is not very different from other new media agencies: providing applications or services for news outlets. But maybe we differ in that we think of ourselves first and foremost as journalists. In our eyes, the products we deliver are articles or stories, albeit ones which are provided not in words and pictures, audio or video, but in code. When we are talking about data journalism, we have to talk about technology, software, devices, and how to tell a story with them.</simpara><simpara>To give an example, we just finished working on an application that pulls in realtime data via a scraper from the German railway website, thus enabling us to develop an interactive <ulink url="http://zugmonitor.sueddeutsche.de/">Train Monitor for Süddeutsche Zeitung</ulink>, showing the delays of long-distance trains in real time. The application data is updated every minute or so, and we are providing an API for it, too. We started doing this several months ago, and have so far collected a huge dataset that grows every hour. By now it amounts to hundreds of thousands of rows of data. The project enables the user to explore this realtime data, and to do research in the archive of previous months. In the end, the story we are telling will be significantly defined by the individual action of the users.</simpara><simpara>In traditional journalism, due to the linear character of written or broadcasted media, we have to think about a beginning, the end, the story arc, and the length and angle of our piece. With data journalism things are different. There is a beginning, yes. People come to the website and get a first impression of the interface. But then they are on their own. Maybe they stay for a minute, or half an hour.</simpara><?dbfo-need height="1in"?><simpara>Our job as data journalists is to provide the framework or environment for this. As well as the coding and data management bits, we have to think of clever ways to design experiences. The User Experience (UX) derives mostly from the (Graphical) User Interface (GUI). In the end, this is the part which will make or break a project. You could have the best code working in the background handling an exciting dataset. But if the front end sucks, nobody will care about it.</simpara><simpara>There is still a lot to learn about and to experiment with. But luckily there is the games industry, which has been innovating with respect to digital narratives, ecosystems, and interfaces for several decades now. So when developing data journalism applications, we should closely watch how game design works and how stories are told in games. Why are casual games like Tetris such fun? And what makes the open worlds of sandbox games like Grand Theft Auto or Skyrim rock?</simpara><simpara>We think that data journalism is here to stay. In a few years, data journalism workflows will be quite naturally embedded in newsrooms, because news websites will have to change. The amount of data that is publicly available will keep on increasing. But luckily, new technologies will continue to enable us to find new ways of telling stories. Some of the stories will be driven by data, and many applications and services will have a journalistic character. The interesting question is which strategy newsrooms will develop to foster this process. Are they going to build up teams of data journalists integrated into their newsroom? Will there be R&amp;D departments, a bit like in-house startups? Or will parts of the work be outsourced to specialized companies? We are still right at the beginning and only time will tell.</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>Lorenz Matzat, OpenDataCity</emphasis></simpara></sect1><sect1 id="_kaas_amp_mulvad_semi_finished_content_for_stakeholder_groups"><title>Kaas &amp; Mulvad: Semi-Finished Content for Stakeholder Groups</title><simpara>Stakeholder media is an emerging sector, largely overlooked by media theorists, which could potentially have a tremendous impact either through online networks or by providing content to news media. It can be defined as (usually online) media controlled by organizational or institutional stakeholders, which is used to advance certain interests and communities. NGOs typically create such media; so do consumer groups, professional associations, labor unions, and so on. The key limit on its ability to influence public opinion or other stakeholders is often that it lacks the capacity to undertake discovery of important information, even more so than the downsized news media. Kaas &amp; Mulvad, a for-profit Danish corporation, is one of the first investigative media enterprises that provides expert capacity to these stakeholder outlets.</simpara><simpara>The firm originated in 2007 as a spinoff of the non-profit Danish Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting (Dicar), which sold investigative reports to media and trained journalists in data analysis. Its founders, Tommy Kaas and Nils Mulvad, were previously reporters in the news industry. Their new firm offers what they call “data plus journalistic insight” (content that remains semi-finished, requiring further editing or rewriting) mainly to stakeholder media, which finalize the content into news releases or stories and distribute it through both news media and their own outlets (such as websites). Direct clients include government institutions, PR firms, labor unions, and NGOs such as EU Transparency and the World Wildlife Fund. The NGO work includes monitoring farm and fishery subsidies, and regular updates on EU lobbyist activities generated through “scraping” of pertinent websites. Indirect clients include foundations that fund NGO projects. The firm also works with the news industry; a tabloid newspaper purchased their celebrity monitoring service, for example.</simpara><figure id="FIG0216" float="none"><title>Stakeholder media companies (Fagblaget3F)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 14 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0214.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0214.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><?dbfo-need height="1in"?><simpara>Data journalism projects in their portfolio include:</simpara><variablelist><varlistentry><term>

Greenpeace, for example, routinely engages journalists as collaborators for its reports. But we know of no other firm whose offerings to stakeholder media are data-driven; it is much more typical for journalists to work with NGOs as reporters, editors, or writers. The current focus in computer-assisted news media is on search and discovery (think of WikiLeaks); here again, Kaas &amp; Mulvad innovate by focusing on data analysis. Their approach requires not only programming skills, but also an understanding of what kind of information can make a story with impact. It can safely be said that anyone who wishes to imitate their service would probably have to acquire those two skill sets through partnership, because individuals rarely possess both.</simpara><sect2 id="_processes_innovative_it_plus_analysis"><title>Processes: Innovative IT Plus Analysis</title><simpara>The firm undertakes about 100 projects per year, ranging in duration from a few hours to a few months. It also continuously invests in projects that expand its capacity and offerings. The celebrity monitoring service was one such experiment. Another involved scraping the Internet for news of home foreclosures and creating maps of the events. The partners say that their first criteria for projects is whether they enjoy the work and learn from it; markets are sought after a new service is defined. They make it clear that in the news industry, they found it difficult to develop new methods and new business.</simpara><simpara>Mulvad comments that:</simpara><blockquote><simpara>We have no editors or bosses to decide which projects we can do, which software or hardware we can buy. We can buy the tools according to project needs, like the best solutions for text scraping and mining. Our goal is to be cutting edge in these areas. We try to get customers who are willing to pay, or if the project is fun we do it for a lower charge.</simpara></blockquote></sect2><sect2 id="_value_created_personal_and_firm_brands_and_revenue"><title>Value Created: Personal and Firm Brands and Revenue</title><simpara>Turnover in 2009 was approximately 2.5 million Danish kroner, or €336,000.

The news industry’s crisis of declining capacity is also a crisis of under-utilization of capacity. Kaas and Mulvad had to leave the news industry to do work they valued, and that pays. Nothing prevented a news organization from capturing that value.
</simpara></listitem><listitem><simpara>
In at least some markets, there exists a profitable market for “semi-finished” content that can serve the interests of stakeholder groups.
</simpara></listitem><listitem><simpara>
However, this opportunity raises the issue of how much control journalists can exercise over the presentation and use of their work by third parties. We recall that this issue already exists within the news industry (where editors can impose changes on a journalist’s product), and it has existed within other media industries (such as the film industry, where conflicts between directors and studios over “final cuts” are hardly rare). It is not a particular moral hazard of stakeholder media, but it will not disappear, either. More attention is needed to the ethics of this growing reality and market.
</simpara></listitem><listitem><simpara>
From a revenue standpoint, a single product or service is not enough. Successful watchdog enterprises would do better to take a portfolio approach, in which consulting, teaching, speaking, and other services bring in extra revenue and support the watchdog brand.

Today there are many news organizations who have gained by adopting new approaches.</simpara><simpara>Terms like “data journalism” and the newest buzzword, “data science,” may sound like they describe something new, but this is not strictly true. Instead these new labels are just ways of characterizing a shift that has been gaining strength over decades.</simpara><simpara>Many journalists seem to be unaware of the size of the revenue that is already generated through data collection, data analytics, and visualization. This is the business of information refinement. With data tools and technologies, it is increasingly possible to shed light on highly complex issues, be this international finance, debt, demography, education, and so on. The term “business intelligence” describes a variety of IT concepts that aim to provide a clear view on what is happening in commercial corporations. The big and profitable companies of our time, including McDonalds, Zara, and H&amp;M, rely on constant data tracking to turn out a profit. And it works pretty well for them.</simpara><simpara>What is changing right now is that the tools developed for this space are now becoming available for other domains, including the media. And there are journalists who get it. Take Tableau, a company that provides a suite of visualization tools. Or the “Big Data” movement, where technology companies use (often open source) software packages to dig through piles of data, extracting insights in milliseconds.</simpara><simpara>These technologies can now be applied to journalism. Teams at the Guardian and The New York Times are constantly pushing the boundaries in this emerging field. And what we are currently seeing is just the tip of the iceberg.</simpara><simpara>But how does this generate money for journalism? The big, worldwide market that is currently opening up is all about transformation of publicly available data into something our that we can process: making data visible and making it human. We want to be able to relate to the big numbers we hear every day in the news—what the millions and billions mean for each of us.</simpara><simpara>There are a number of very profitable data-driven media companies, who have simply applied this principle earlier than others. They enjoy healthy growth rates and sometimes impressive profits. One example is Bloomberg. The company operates about 300,000 terminals and delivers financial data to its users. If you are in the money business, this is a power tool. Each terminal comes with a color-coded keyboard and up to 30,000 options to look up, compare, analyze, and help you to decide what to do next. This core business generates an estimated $6.3 billion (US) per year—at least as estimated in <ulink url="http://nyti.ms/IQcRgY">a 2008 piece by The New York Times</ulink>. As a result, Bloomberg has been hiring journalists left, right and center, they bought the venerable but loss-making “Business Week,” and so on.</simpara><simpara>Another example is the Canadian media conglomerate today known as Thomson Reuters. They started with one newspaper, bought up a number of well-known titles in the UK, and then decided two decades ago to leave the newspaper business. Instead, they have grown based on information services, aiming to provide a deeper perspective for clients in a number of industries. If you worry about how to make money with specialized information, my advice would be to just <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thomson_Corporation">read about the company’s history on Wikipedia</ulink>.</simpara><simpara>And look at the Economist. The magazine has built an excellent, influential brand on its media side. At the same time, the “Economist Intelligence Unit” is now more like a consultancy, reporting about relevant trends and forecasts for almost any country in the world. They are employing hundreds of journalists and claim to serve about 1.5 million customers worldwide.</simpara><simpara>And there are many niche data-driven services that could serve as inspiration: eMarketer in the US, providing comparisons, charts, and advice for anybody interested in internet marketing; Stiftung Warentest in Germany, an institution looking into the quality of products and services; Statista, again from Germany, a start-up helping to visualize publicly available information.</simpara><simpara>Around the world, there is currently a wave of startups in this sector, naturally covering a wide range of areas; for example, Timetric, which aims to “reinvent business research,” OpenCorporates, Kasabi, Infochimps, and Data Market. Many of these are arguably experiments, but together they can be taken as an important sign of change.</simpara><simpara>Then there is the public media, which in terms of data-driven journalism, is a sleeping giant. In Germany, €7.2 billion per year is flowing into this sector. Journalism is a special product: if done well, it is not just about making money, but serves an important role in society. Once it is clear that data journalism can provide better, more reliable insights more easily, some of this money could be used for new jobs in newsrooms.</simpara><simpara>With data journalism, it is not just about being first, but about being a trusted source of information. In this multichannel world, attention can be generated in abundance, but <emphasis>trust</emphasis> is an increasingly scarce resource. Data journalists can help to collate, synthesize, and present diverse and often difficult sources of information in a way that gives their audience real insights into complex issues. Rather than just recycling press releases and retelling stories they’ve heard elsewhere, data journalists can give readers a clear, comprehensible, and preferably customizable perspective with interactive graphics and direct access to primary sources. Not trivial, but certainly valuable.</simpara><simpara>So what is the best approach for aspiring data journalists to explore this field and convince management to support innovative projects?</simpara><?dbfo-need height="1in"?><simpara>The first step should be to look for immediate opportunities close to home: low-hanging fruit. For example, you might already have collections of structured texts and data that you could use. A prime example of this is the “Homicide database” of the Los Angeles Times. Here, data and visualizations are the core, not an afterthought. The editors collect all the crimes they find and only then write articles based on this. Over time, such collections are becoming better, deeper, and more valuable.</simpara><simpara>This might not work the first time. But it will over time. One very hopeful indicator here is that the Texas Tribune and ProPublica, which are both arguably post-print media companies, reported that funding for their non-profit journalism organizations exceeded their goals much earlier than planned.</simpara><simpara>Becoming proficient in all things data—whether as a generalist or as a specialist focused on one aspect of the data food chain—provides a valuable perspective for people who believe in journalism.

We learn about how data sources have been used to augment and improve coverage of everything from elections to spending, riots to corruption, the performance of schools to the price of water. As well as larger media organizations such as the BBC, the Chicago Tribune, the Guardian, the Financial Times, Helsingin Sanomat, La Nación, Wall Street Journal, and the Zeit Online, we learn from smaller initiatives such as California Watch, <phrase role="keep-together">Hack/Hackers</phrase>Buenos Aires, ProPublica, and a group of local Brazilian citizen-journalists called Friends of Januária.</simpara><sect1 id="_the_opportunity_gap"><title>The Opportunity Gap</title><simpara><ulink url="http://projects.propublica.org/schools">The Opportunity Gap</ulink> used never-before-<phrase role="keep-together">released</phrase> U.S. Department of Education civil rights data and showed that some states, like Florida, have levelled the field and offer rich and poor students roughly equal access to high-level courses, while other states, like Kansas, Maryland, and Oklahoma, offer less opportunity in districts with poorer families.</simpara><figure id="FIG031" float="none"><title>The Opportunity Gap project (ProPublica)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 1 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0301.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0301.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><simpara>The data included every public school in a district with 3,000 students or more. More than three-quarters of all public-school children were represented. A reporter in our newsroom obtained the data and our Computer-Assisted Reporting Director cleaned it very extensively.</simpara><simpara>It was roughly a three-month project. Altogether, six people worked on the story and news application: two editors, a reporter, a CAR person, and two developers. Most of us weren’t working on it exclusively throughout that period.</simpara><simpara>The project really required our combined skills: deep domain knowledge, an understanding of data best practices, design and coding skills, and so on. More importantly it required an ability to find the story in the data. It also took editing, not only for the story that went with it, but for the news app itself.</simpara><simpara>For the data cleaning and analysis we used mostly Excel and cleaning scripts, as well as MS Access. The news app was written in Ruby on Rails and uses JavaScript pretty extensively.</simpara><simpara>In addition to an overview story, our coverage included an interactive news application, which let readers understand and find examples within this large national dataset that related to them. Using our news app, a reader could find their local school—say, for example, <ulink url="http://goo.gl/HJVCf">Central High School in Newark, N.J.</ulink>—and immediately see how well the school does in a wide variety of areas. Then they could hit a button that says <ulink url="http://goo.gl/WrAIi">“Compare to High and Low Poverty Schools”</ulink>, and immediately see other high schools, their relative poverty, and the extent to which they offer higher math, Advanced Placement, and other important courses. In our example, Central High is bookended by Millburn Sr. High. The Opportunity Gap shows how only 1% of Milburn students get Free or Reduced Price lunch but 72% of them are taking at least one AP course. In the other extreme, International High has 85% of its students getting Free/Reduced Price lunch and only 1% taking AP courses.</simpara><simpara>Through this example a reader can use something they know—a local high school—to understand something they don’t know: the distribution of educational access, and the extent to which poverty is a predictor of that access.</simpara><simpara>We also integrated the app with Facebook, so readers could log into Facebook and our app would automatically let them know about schools that might interest them.</simpara><simpara>Traffic to all of our news apps is excellent, and we’re particularly proud of the way this app tells a complex story; more to the point, it helps readers tell their own particular story for themselves.</simpara><simpara>As with many projects that start with government data, the data needed a lot of cleaning. For instance, while there are only around 30 possible Advanced Placement courses, some schools reported having hundreds of them. This took lots of manual checking and phone calls to schools for confirmation and corrections.</simpara><simpara>We also worked really hard at making sure the app told a “far” story and a “near” story. That is, the app needed to present the reader with a broad, abstract national picture; a way to compare how states did relative to each other on educational access. But given that abstraction sometimes leaves readers confused as to what the data means to them, we also wanted readers to be able to find their own local school and compare it to high- and low-poverty schools in their area.</simpara><simpara>If I were to advise aspiring data journalists interested in taking on this kind of project, I’d say you have to know the material and be inquisitive! All of the rules that apply to other kinds of journalism apply here. You have to get the facts right, make sure you tell the story well, and—crucially—make sure your news app doesn’t disagree with a story you’re writing. If it does, one of the two might be wrong.</simpara><simpara>Also, if you want to learn to code, the most important thing is to start. You might like learning through classes or through books or videos, but make sure you have a really good idea for a project and a deadline by which you have to complete it. If there’s a story in your head that can only come out as a news app, then not knowing how to program won’t stop you!</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>Scott Klein, ProPublica</emphasis></simpara></sect1><sect1 id="_a_nine_month_investigation_into_european_structural_funds"><title>A Nine Month Investigation into European Structural Funds</title><simpara>In 2010, the <ulink url="http://www.ft.com/intl/eu-funds">Financial Times</ulink> and the <ulink url="http://bit.ly/bureau-billions">Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ)</ulink> joined forces to investigate European Structural Funds. The intention was to review who the beneficiaries of European Structural Funds are and check whether the money was put to good use. At €347 billion over seven years, Structural Funds is the second largest subsidy program in the EU. The program has existed for decades, but apart from broad, generalized overviews, there was little transparency about who the beneficiaries are. As part of a rule change in the current funding round, authorities are obliged to make public a list of beneficiaries, including project description and amount of EU and national funding received.</simpara><figure id="FIG032" float="none"><title>EU Structural Funds investigation (Financial Times and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 2 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0302.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0302.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><simpara>The project team was made up of up to 12 journalists and one full-time coder collaborating for nine months.

We believed that the Commission would have an overarching database of project data that we could either access directly, or which we could obtain through a Freedom of Information request. No such database exists to the level of detail we required. We quickly realized that many of the links the Commission provided were faulty and that most of the authorities published the data in PDF format, rather than analysis-friendly formats such as CSV or XML.</simpara><simpara>A team of up to 12 people worked to identify the latest data and collate the links into one spreadsheet we used for collaboration. Since the data fields were not uniform (for example, headers were in different languages, some datasets used different currencies, and some included breakdowns of EU and National Funding) we needed to be as precise as possible in translating and describing the data fields available in each dataset.</simpara></sect2><sect2 id="_2_download_and_prepare_the_data"><title>2. Download and prepare the data</title><simpara>The next step consisted of downloading all the spreadsheets, PDFs, and, in some cases, web scraping the original data.</simpara><simpara>Each dataset had to then be standardized. Our biggest task was extracting data out of PDFs, some hundreds of pages long. Much of this was done using UnPDF and ABBYY FineReader, which allow data to be extracted to formats such as CSV or Excel.</simpara><simpara>It also involved checking and double-checking that the PDF extraction tools had captured the data correctly.

  This entailed typing particular keywords of interest (e.g., “tobacco,” “hotel,” “company A” into the search engine.

</simpara></listitem></varlistentry></variablelist><simpara>Our story lines were informed by both these methods, but also through on-the-ground and desk research.</simpara><simpara>Double-checking the integrity of the data (by aggregating and checking against what authorities said had been allocated) took a substantial amount of time. One of the main problems was that authorities would for the most part only divulge the amount of “EU and national funding”. Under EU rules, each program is allowed to fund a certain percentage of the total cost using EU funding. The level of EU funding is determined, at program level, by the so-called co-financing rate. Each program (e.g., regional competitiveness) is made up of numerous projects. At the project levels, technically one project could receive 100 percent EU funding, and another none at all, as long as grouped together, the amount of EU funding at the program level is not more than the approved co-financing rate.</simpara><simpara>This meant that we needed to check each EU amount of funding we cited in our stories with the beneficiary company in question.</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>Cynthia O’Murchu, Financial Times</emphasis></simpara></sect2></sect1><sect1 id="_the_eurozone_meltdown"><title>The Eurozone Meltdown</title><simpara>So we’re <ulink url="http://on.wsj.com/tYM82O">covering the Eurozone meltdown</ulink>.

It is numbing.</simpara><simpara>The Page One editors call a meeting to discuss ideas for year-end coverage and as we leave the meeting, I find myself wondering: what must it be like to be living through this?</simpara><simpara>Is this like 2008 when I was laid off and dark news was incessant?

In Spain?</simpara><simpara>I turned back and followed Mike Allen, the Page One editor, into his office and pitched the idea of telling the crisis through families in the Eurozone by looking first at the data, finding demographic profiles to understand what made up a family and then surfacing that along with pictures and interviews‚ audio of the generations.

I read up on living arrangements and divorce rates, looked at surveys on well-being and savings rates. I browsed national statistics divisions, called the UN population bureau, the IMF, Eurostat, and the OECD until I found an economist who had spent his career tracking families. He led me to a scholar on family composition. She pointed me to white papers on my topic.</simpara><simpara>With my editor, Sam Enriquez, we narrowed down the countries. We gathered a team to discuss the visual approach and which reporters could deliver words, audio and story. Matt Craig, the Page One photo editor, set to work finding the shooters. Matt Murray, the Deputy Managing Editor for world coverage, sent a memo to the bureau chiefs requesting help from the reporters. (This was crucial: sign-off from the top.)</simpara><simpara>But first the data. Mornings I’d export data into spreadsheets and make charts to see trends: savings shrinking, pensions disappearing, mothers returning to work, health spending, along with government debt and unemployment. Afternoons I’d look at those data in clusters, putting the countries against each other to find stories.</simpara><simpara>I did this for a week before I got lost in the weeds and started to doubt myself.

Waiting to see what the families said. We designed the look of the interactive. I stole a palette from a Tintin novel, we worked through the interaction. And when it was all together and we had storyboards, we added back in some (not much but some) of the original charts. Just enough to punctuate each story, just enough to harden the themes.

Find data and developers</title><simpara>Helsingin Sanomat has organized HS Open hackathons since March 2011. We invite Finnish coders, journalists, and graphic designers to the basement of our building. Participants are divided into groups of three, and they are encouraged to develop applications and visualizations. We have had about 60 participants in each of our three events so far. We decided that campaign funding data should be the focus of HS Open #2, May 2011.</simpara><simpara>The National Audit Office of Finland is the authority that keeps records of campaign funding. That was the easy part. Chief Information Officer Jaakko Hamunen built a website that provides real-time access to their campaign funding database. The Audit Office made this in just two months after our request.</simpara><simpara>The <ulink url="http://www.vaalirahoitus.fi/">Vaalirahoitus.fi</ulink> website will provide the public and the press with information on campaign funding for every election from now on.</simpara><figure id="FIG0312" float="0"><title>Election financing (Helsingin Sanomat)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 12 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0312.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0312.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure></sect2><sect2 id="_2_brainstorm_for_ideas"><title>2. Brainstorm for ideas</title><simpara>The participants of HS Open 2 came up with twenty different prototypes about what to do with the data. You can find all the prototypes <ulink url="http://bit.ly/hs-prototype">on our website</ulink> (text in Finnish).</simpara><simpara>A bioinformatics researcher called Janne Peltola noted that campaign funding data looked like the gene data they research, in terms of containing many interdependencies. In bioinformatics there is an open source tool called <ulink url="http://www.cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape</ulink> that is used to map these interdependencies. So we ran the data through Cytoscape, and got a very interesting prototype.</simpara></sect2><sect2 id="_3_implement_the_idea_on_paper_and_on_the_web"><title>3. Implement the idea on paper and on the Web</title><simpara>The law on campaign funding states that elected members of parliament must declare their funding two months after the elections. In practice this meant that we got the real data in mid-June. In HS Open, we had data only from MPs who had filed before the deadline.</simpara><simpara>There was also a problem with the data format. The National Audit Office provided the data as two CSV files. One contained the total budget of campaigns, the other listed all the donors. We had to combine these two, creating a file that contained three columns: donor, receiver, and amount. If the politicians had used their own money, in our data format it looked like Politician A donated X euros to Politician A. Counter-intuitive perhaps, but it worked for Cytoscape.</simpara><simpara>When the data was cleaned and reformatted, we just ran it through Cytoscape. Then our graphics department made a full-page graphic out of it.</simpara><simpara>Finally we created a beautiful visualization on our <ulink url="http://www.vaaliraha.com/">website</ulink>. This was not a network analysis graphic. We wanted to give people an easy way to explore how much campaign funding there is and who gives it. The first view shows the distribution of funding between MPs. When you click on one MP, you get the breakdown of his or her funding. You can also vote on whether this particular donor is good or not. The visualization was made by Juha Rouvinen and Jukka Kokko, from an ad agency called Satumaa.</simpara><simpara>The web version of campaign funding visualization uses the same data as the network analysis.</simpara></sect2><sect2 id="_4_publish_the_data"><title>4. Publish the data</title><simpara>Of course, the National Audit Office already publishes the data, so there was no need to republish. But, as we had cleaned up the data and given it a better structure, we decided to publish it. We give out our data with a <ulink url="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution licence</ulink>. Subsequently several independent developers have made visualizations of the data, some of which we have published.</simpara><simpara>The tools we used for the project were Excel and Google Refine for data cleaning and analysis; Cytoscape for network analysis; and Illustrator and Flash for the visualizations. The Flash should have been HTML5, but we ran out of time.</simpara><simpara>What did we learn? Perhaps the most important lesson was that data structures can be very hard. If the original data is not in suitable format, recalculating and converting it will take a lot of time.</simpara></sect2></sect1><sect1 id="_electoral_hack_in_realtime_hacks_hackers_buenos_aires"><title>Electoral Hack in Realtime (Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires)</title><figure id="FIG0313" float="none"><title>Elections 2011 (Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 13 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0313.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0313.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><simpara><ulink url="http://elecciones.hhba.info">Electoral Hack</ulink> is a political analysis project that visualizes data from the provisional ballot results of the October 2011 elections in Argentina. The system also features information from previous elections and socio-demographic statistics from across the country. The project was updated in real time with information from the provisional ballot count of the national elections of 2011 in Argentina, and gave summaries of election results. It was an initiative of Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires with the political analyst Andy Tow, and was a collaborative effort of journalists, developers, designers, analysts, political scientists, and others from the local chapter of Hacks/Hackers.</simpara><sect2 id="_what_data_did_we_use"><title>What Data Did We Use?</title><simpara>All data came from official sources: the National Electoral Bureau provided access to data of the provisional count by Indra; the Department of the Interior provided information about elected posts and candidates from different political parties; a <ulink url="http://yoquierosaber.org/">university project</ulink> provided biographical information and the policy platforms of each presidential ticket; while socio-demographic information came from the 2001 National Census of Population and Housing (INDEC), the 2010 Census (INDEC), and the Ministry of Health.</simpara></sect2><sect2 id="_how_was_it_developed"><title>How Was It Developed?</title><simpara>The application was generated during the 2011 Election Hackathon by Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires the day before the election on October 23, 2011. The hackathon saw the participation of 30 volunteers with a variety of different backgrounds. Electoral Hack was developed as an open platform that could be improved over time. For the technology, we used Google Fusion Tables, Google Maps, and vector graphics libraries.</simpara><simpara>We worked on the construction of polygons for displaying geographic mapping and electoral demographics. Combining polygons in GIS software and geometries from public tables in Google Fusion Tables, we generated tables with keys corresponding to the electoral database of the Ministry of Interior, Indra, and sociodemographic data from INDEC. From this, we created visualizations in Google Maps.</simpara><simpara>Using the Google Maps API, we published several thematic maps representing the spatial distribution of voting with different tones of color, where the intensity of color represented the percentage of votes for the various presidential tickets in different administrative departments and polling stations, with particular emphasis on major urban centers: the City of Buenos Aires, the 24 districts of Greater Buenos Aires, the City of Cordoba, and Rosario.</simpara><simpara>We used the same technique to generate thematic maps of previous elections, namely the presidential primaries of 2011 and the election of 2007, as well as of the distribution of sociodemographic data, such as for poverty, child mortality, and living conditions, allowing for analysis and comparison. The project also showed the spatial distribution of the differences in percentage of votes obtained by each ticket in the general election of October compared to the August primary election.</simpara><simpara>Later, using partial data from the provisional ballot counts, we created an animated map depicting the anatomy of the count, in which the progress of the vote count is shown from the closing of the local polls until the following morning.</simpara></sect2><sect2 id="_pros"><title>Pros</title><itemizedlist><listitem><simpara>

Maps from the project were used by several media platforms during the elections and in subsequent days. As the days went by, the maps and visualizations were updated, increasing traffic even more. On Election Day, the site created that very day received about 20 thousand unique visitors and its maps were reproduced on the cover page of the newspaper Página/12 for two consecutive days, as well as in articles in La Nación. Some maps appeared in the print edition of the newspaper Clarín. It was the first time that an interactive display of real-time maps had been used in the history of Argentine journalism. In the central maps one could clearly see the overwhelming victory of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner by 54 percent of the vote, broken up by color saturation. It also served to help users understand specific cases where local candidates had landslide victories in the provinces.</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>Mariano Blejman, Mariana Berruezo, Sergio Sorín, Andy Tow, and Martín Sarsale from Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires</emphasis></simpara></sect2></sect1><sect1 id="_data_in_the_news_wikileaks"><title>Data in the News: WikiLeaks</title><simpara>It began with one of the investigative reporting team asking, “You’re good with spreadsheets, aren’t you?” And this was one hell of a spreadsheet: 92,201 rows of data, each one containing a detailed breakdown of a military event in Afghanistan. This was the <ulink url="http://bit.ly/guardian-warlogs">WikiLeaks war logs</ulink>. Part one, that is. There were to be two more episodes to follow: Iraq and the cables. The official term was SIGACTS: the US military Significant Actions Database.</simpara><simpara>The Afghanistan war logs—shared with The New York Times and Der Spiegel—was data journalism in action. What we wanted to do was enable our team of specialist reporters to get great human stories from the information—and we wanted to analyze it to get the big picture, to show how the war really is going.</simpara><simpara>It was central to what we would do quite early on that we would not publish the full database. WikiLeaks was already going to do that and we wanted to make sure that we didn’t reveal the names of informants or unnecessarily endanger NATO troops. At the same time, we needed to make the data easier to use for our team of investigative reporters led by David Leigh and Nick Davies (who had negotiated releasing the data with Julian Assange). We also wanted to make it simpler to access key information, out there in the real world, as clear and open as we could make it.</simpara><simpara>The data came to us as a huge Excel file; over 92,201 rows of data, some with nothing in it at all or poorly formatted. It didn’t help reporters trying to trawl through the data for stories and was too big to run meaningful reports on.</simpara><simpara>Our team built a simple internal database using SQL. Reporters could now search stories for key words or events. Suddenly the dataset became accessible and generating stories became easier.</simpara><simpara>The data was well structured: each event had the following key data: time, date, a description, casualty figures, and—crucially—detailed latitude and longitude.</simpara><figure id="FIG0314" float="0"><title>The WikiLeaks war logs (the Guardian)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 14 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0314.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0314.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><simpara>We also started filtering the data to help us tell one of the key stories of the war: the rise in IED (improvised explosive device) attacks, homemade roadside bombs which are unpredictable and difficult to fight. This dataset was still massive, but easier to manage. There were around 7,500 IED explosions or ambushes (an ambush is where the attack is combined with, for example, small arms fire or rocket grenades) between 2004 and 2009. There were another 8,000 IEDs which were found and cleared. We wanted to see how they changed over time—and how they compared. This data allowed us to see that the south, where British and Canadian troops were based then, was the worst-hit area—which backed up what our reporters who had covered the war knew.</simpara><simpara>The Iraq war logs release in October 2010 dumped another 391,000 records of the Iraq war into the public arena.</simpara><simpara>This was in a different league to the Afghanistan leak; there’s a good case for saying this made the war the most documented in history. Every minor detail was now there for us to analyze and break down. But one factor stands out: the sheer volume of deaths, most of which are civilians.</simpara><simpara>As with Afghanistan, the Guardian decided not to republish the entire database, largely because we couldn’t be sure the summary field didn’t contain confidential details of informants and so on.</simpara><simpara>But we did allow our users to download a spreadsheet containing the records of every incident where somebody died, nearly 60,000 in all. We removed the summary field so it was just the basic data: the military heading, numbers of deaths, and the geographic breakdown.</simpara><simpara>We also took all these incidents where someone had died and <ulink url="http://bit.ly/guardian-iraq-map">put it on a map using Google Fusion tables</ulink>. It was not perfect, but a start in trying to map the patterns of destruction that had ravaged Iraq.</simpara><simpara>December 2010 saw the release of the cables. This was in another league altogether, a huge dataset of official documents: 251,287 dispatches, from more than 250 worldwide US embassies and consulates. It’s a unique picture of US diplomatic language—including over 50,000 documents covering the current Obama administration. But what did the data include?</simpara><simpara>The cables themselves came via the huge Secret Internet Protocol Router Network, or SIPRNet. SIPRNet is the worldwide US military Internet system, kept separate from the ordinary civilian Internet and run by the Department of Defense in Washington. Since
the attacks of September 2001, there had been a move in the US to link up archives of government information, in the hope that key intelligence no longer gets trapped in information silos or “stovepipes.” An increasing number of US embassies have become linked to SIPRNet over the past decade, so that military and diplomatic information can be shared. By 2002, 125 embassies were on SIPRNet: by 2005, the number had risen to 180, and by now the vast majority of US missions worldwide are linked to the system—which is why the bulk of these cables are from 2008 and 2009. As David Leigh wrote:</simpara><blockquote><simpara>An embassy dispatch marked SIPDIS is automatically downloaded onto its embassy classified website. From there, it can be accessed not only by anyone in the state department, but also by anyone in the US military who has a security clearance up to the “Secret” level, a password, and a computer connected to SIPRNet.</simpara></blockquote><simpara>…which astonishingly covers over 3 million people. There are several layers of data in here; all the way up to <emphasis>SECRET NOFORN</emphasis>, which means that they are designed never be shown to non-US citizens. Instead, they are supposed to be read by officials in Washington up to the level of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The cables are normally drafted by the local ambassador or subordinates. The “Top Secret” and above foreign intelligence documents cannot be accessed from SIPRNet.</simpara><simpara>Unlike the previous releases, this was predominantly text, not quantified or with identical data.

We hosted two initial meetups to publicize the idea of greater collaboration between journalists and software developers, with between 120 and 150 people at each event. For a third meeting we had a 30-hour hackathon with eight people at a digital journalism conference in the city of Rosario, 300 kilometers from Buenos Aires.</simpara><simpara>A recurring theme in these meetings was the desire to scrape large volumes of data from the Web, and then to represent it visually. To help with this, a project called Mapa76.info was born, which helps users to extract data and then to display it using maps and timelines. Not an easy task.</simpara><figure id="FIG0315" float="none"><title>Mapa76 (Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 15 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0315.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0315.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><simpara>Why Mapa76? On March 24, 1976 there was a coup in Argentina, which lasted until 1983. In that period, there were an estimated 30,000 disappeared people, thousands of deaths, and 500 children born in captivity appropriated for the military dictatorship. Over 30 years later, the number of people in Argentina convicted of crimes against humanity committed during the dictatorship amounts to 262 people (September 2011). Currently there are 14 ongoing trials and 7 with definite starting dates. There are 802 people in various open court cases.</simpara><simpara>These prosecutions generate large volumes of data that are difficult for researchers, journalists, human rights organizations, judges, prosecutors, and others to process. Data is produced in a distributed manner and investigators often don’t take advantage of software tools to assist them with interpreting it. Ultimately this means that facts are often overlooked and hypotheses are often limited. Mapa76 is an investigative tool providing open access to this information for journalistic, legal, juridical, and historical purposes.</simpara><simpara>To prepare for the hackathon, we created a platform which developers and journalists could use to collaborate on the day of the event. Martin Sarsale developed some basic algorithms to extract structured data from simple text documents. Some libraries were also used from DocumentCloud.org project, but not many. The platform would automatically analyze and extract names, dates and places from the texts—and would enable users to explore key facts about different cases (e.g., date of birth, place of arrest, alleged place of disappearance, and so on).</simpara><simpara>Our goal was to provide a platform for the automatic extraction of data on the judgments of the military dictatorship in Argentina. We wanted a way to automatically (or at least semi-automatically) display key data related to cases from 1976-1983 based on written evidence, arguments and judgments. The extracted data (names, places and dates) are collected, stored, and can be analyzed and refined by the researcher, as well as being explored using maps, timelines, and network analysis tools.</simpara><simpara>The project will allow journalists and investigators, prosecutors and witnesses to follow the story of a person’s life, including the course of their captivity and subsequent disappearance or release. Where information is absent, users can comb through a vast number of documents for information that could be of possible relevance to the case.</simpara><simpara>For the hackathon, we made a public announcement through <ulink url="http://www.meetup.com/HacksHackersBA/">Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires</ulink>, which then had around 200 members (at the time of writing, there are around 540). We also contacted many human rights associations. The meeting was attended by about forty people, including journalists, advocacy organizations, developers and designers.</simpara><simpara>During the hackathon, we identified tasks that different types of participants could pursue independently to help things run smoothly. For example, we asked designers to work on an interface that combined maps and timelines, we asked developers to look into ways of extracting structured data and algorithms to disambiguate names, and we asked journalists to look into what happened with specific people, to compare different versions of stories, and to comb through documents to tell stories about particular cases.</simpara><simpara>Probably the main problem we had after the hackathon was that our project was very ambitious, our short-term objectives were demanding, and it is hard to coordinate a loose-knit network of volunteers. Nearly everyone involved with the project had a busy day job and many also participated in other events and projects. Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires had 9 meetings in 2011.</simpara><simpara>The project is currently under active development. There is a core team of four people working with over a dozen collaborators. We have a <ulink url="http://groups.google.com/group/mapa76-dev/">public mailing list</ulink> and <ulink url="https://github.com/mapa76/">code repository</ulink> through which anyone can get involved with the project.</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>Mariano Blejman, Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires</emphasis></simpara></sect1><sect1 id="_the_guardian_datablog_8217_s_coverage_of_the_uk_riots"><title>The Guardian Datablog’s Coverage of the UK Riots</title><simpara>During the summer of 2011, the UK was hit by a wave of riots. At the time, politicians suggested that these actions were categorically not linked to poverty and those who did the looting were simply criminals. Moreover, the Prime Minister, along with leading conservative politicians, blamed social media for causing the riots, suggesting that incitement had taken place on these platforms and that riots were organized using Facebook, Twitter, and Blackberry Messenger (BBM). There were calls to temporarily shut social media down. Because the government did not launch an inquiry into why the riots happened, the Guardian, in collaboration with the London School of Economics, set up the groundbreaking <ulink url="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/series/reading-the-riots">Reading the Riots</ulink> project to address these issues.</simpara><figure id="FIG0316" float="0"><title>The UK Riots: every verified incident (the Guardian)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 16 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0316.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0316.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><simpara>The newspaper extensively used data journalism to enable the public to better understand who was doing the looting and why. What is more, they also worked with another team of academics, led by Professor Rob Procter at the University of Manchester, to better understand the role of social media, which the Guardian itself had extensively used in its reporting during the riots. The Reading the Riots team was led by Paul Lewis, the Guardian’s Special Projects Editor. During the riots Paul reported on the front line in cities across England (most notably via his Twitter account, @paullewis). This second team worked on 2.6 million riot tweets donated by Twitter. The main aim of this social media work was to see how rumors circulate on Twitter, the function different users/actors have in propagating and spreading information flows, to see whether the platform was used to incite, and to examine other forms of organization.</simpara><simpara>In terms of the use of data journalism and data visualizations, it is useful to distinguish between two key periods: the period of the riots themselves and the ways in which data helped tell stories as the riots unfolded; and then a second period of much more intense research with two sets of academic teams working with the Guardian, to collect data, analyze it, and write in-depth reports on the findings. The results from the first phase of the Reading the Riots project were published during a week of extensive coverage in early December 2011. Below are some key examples of how data journalism was used during both periods.</simpara><sect2 id="_phase_one_the_riots_as_they_happened"><title>Phase One: The Riots As They Happened</title><simpara>By using simple maps, the Guardian data team showed the <ulink url="http://bit.ly/guardian-riots-map">locations of confirmed riots spots</ulink> and through <ulink url="http://bit.ly/guardian-riots-poverty">mashing up deprivation data with where the riots took place</ulink>, started debunking the main political narrative that there was no link to poverty. Both of these examples used off-the-shelf mapping tools, and in the second example, combine location data with another dataset to start making other connections and links.</simpara><simpara>In relation to the use of social media during the riots (in this case, Twitter), the newspaper created a <ulink url="http://bit.ly/guardian-riots-twitter">visualization of riot-related hashtags used during this period</ulink>, which highlighted that Twitter was mainly used to respond to the riots rather than to organize people to go looting, with <emphasis>#riotcleanup</emphasis>, the spontaneous campaign to clean up the streets after the rioting, showing the most significant spike during the riot period.</simpara></sect2><sect2 id="_phase_two_reading_the_riots"><title>Phase Two: Reading the Riots</title><simpara>When the paper reported its findings from months of intensive research and working closely with two academic teams, two visualizations stand out and have been widely discussed. The first one, <ulink url="http://bit.ly/guardian-riots-commute">a short video</ulink>, shows the results of combining the known places where people rioted with their home address and showing a so-called “riot commute.” Here the paper worked with transport mapping specialist, ITO World, to model the most likely route traveled by the rioters as they made their way to various locations to go looting, highlighting different patterns for different cities, with some traveling long distances.</simpara><simpara>The second one deals with the ways in which rumors spread on Twitter. In discussion with the academic team, seven rumors were agreed on for analysis. The academic team then collected all data related to each rumor and devised a coding schedule that coded the tweet according to four main codes: people simply repeating the rumor (making a claim), rejecting it (making a counter claim), questioning it (query), or simply commenting (comment). All tweets were coded in triplicate and <ulink url="http://bit.ly/guardian-riots">the results were visualized</ulink> by the Guardian Interactive Team. The Guardian team has <ulink url="http://bit.ly/guardian-riots-twitter-interactive">written about how they built the visualization</ulink>.</simpara><?dbfo-need height="1in"?><simpara>What is so striking about this visualization is that it powerfully shows what is very difficult to describe and that is the viral nature of rumors and the ways in which their life cycle plays out over time. The role of the mainstream media is evident in some of these rumors (for example, outright debunking them, or indeed confirming them quickly as news), as is the corrective nature of Twitter itself in terms of dealing with such rumors. This visualization not only greatly aided the storytelling, but also gave a real insight into how rumors work on Twitter, which provides useful information for dealing with future events.</simpara><simpara>What is clear from the last example is the powerful synergy between the newspaper and an academic team capable of an in-depth analysis of 2.6 million riot tweets. Although the academic team built a set of bespoke tools to do their analysis, they are now working to <ulink url="http://www.analysingsocialmedia.org/">make these widely available to anyone who wishes to use them</ulink> in due course, providing a workbench for their analysis. Combined with the how-to description provided by the Guardian team, it will provide a useful case study of how such social media analysis and visualization can be used by others to tell such important stories.</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>Farida Vis, University of Leicester</emphasis></simpara></sect2></sect1><sect1 id="_illinois_school_report_cards"><title>Illinois School Report Cards</title><simpara>Each year, the Illinois State Board of Education releases school “report cards,” data on the demographics and performance of all the public schools Illinois.

(There were actually three people actively working on the recent project, but none were full-time, so it adds up to about two.)</simpara><?dbfo-need height="1in"?><simpara>A key piece of this project was information design. Although we present far less data than is available, it’s still a <emphasis>lot</emphasis> of data, and making it digestible was a challenge. Luckily, we got to borrow someone from our graphics desk—a designer who specializes in presenting complicated information. He taught us much about chart design and, in general, guided us to a presentation that is readable, but does not underestimate the reader’s ability or desire to understand the numbers.</simpara><simpara>The site was built in Python and Django. The data is housed in MongoDB—the schools data is heterogeneous and hierarchical, making it a poor fit for a relational database.

The charts are drawn with Flot.</simpara><simpara>The app is also home to the many stories about school performance that we’ve written. It acts as sort of a portal in that way; when there’s a new school performance story, we put it at the top of the app, alongside lists of schools relevant to the story.

The particular scam that was alleged is called <emphasis>upcoding</emphasis>, which means reporting patients having more complicated conditions—worth higher reimbursement—than actually existed. But a key source was a union that was fighting with the hospital chain’s management, and the CaliforniaWatch team knew that independent verification was necessary for the story to have credibility.</simpara><simpara>Luckily, California’s department of health has public records that give very detailed information about each case treated in all the state’s hospitals. The 128 variables include up to 25 diagnosis codes from the “International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems” manual (commonly known as ICD-9) published by the World Health Organization. While patients aren’t identified by name in the data, other variables tell the age of the patient, how the costs are paid, and which hospital treated him. The reporters realized that with these records, they could see if the hospitals owned by the chain were reporting certain unusual conditions at significantly higher rates than were being seen at other hospitals.</simpara><figure id="FIG0318" float="0"><title>Kwashiorkor (California Watch)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 18 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0318.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0318.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><simpara>The datasets were large; nearly 4 million records per year. The reporters wanted to study six years worth of records in order to see how patterns changed over time. They ordered the data from the state agency; it arrived on CD-ROMs that were easily copied into a desktop computer. The reporter doing the actual data analysis used a system called <ulink url="http://www.sas.com/">SAS</ulink> to work with the data. SAS is very powerful (allowing analysis of many millions of records) and is used by many government agencies, including the California health department, but it is expensive—the same kind of analysis could have been done using any of a variety of other database tools, such as Microsoft Access or the open-source <ulink url="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</ulink>.</simpara><simpara>With the data in hand and the programs written to study it, finding suspicious patterns was relatively simple. For example, one allegation was that the chain was reporting various degrees of malnutrition at much higher rates than were seen at other hospitals. Using SAS, the data analyst extracted frequency tables that showed the numbers of malnutrition cases being reported each year by each of California’s more than 300 acute care hospitals. The raw frequency tables then were imported into Microsoft Excel for closer inspection of the patterns for each hospital; Excel’s ability to sort, filter and calculate rates from the raw numbers made seeing the patterns easy.</simpara><simpara>Particularly striking were reports of a condition called Kwashiorkor, a protein deficiency syndrome that is almost exclusively seen in starving infants in famine-afflicted developing countries. Yet the chain was reporting its hospitals were diagnosing Kwashiorkor among elderly Californians at rates as much as 70 times higher than <ulink url="http://bit.ly/californiawatch-malnutrition">the state average of all hospitals</ulink>.</simpara><simpara>For other stories, the analysis used similar techniques to examine the reported rates <ulink url="http://bit.ly/californiawatch-rare">of conditions like septicemia, encephalopathy, malignant hypertension, and autonomic nerve disorder</ulink>. And another analysis looked at allegations that the chain was admitting from its emergency rooms into hospital care <ulink url="http://bit.ly/californiawatch-chains">unusually high percentages of Medicare patients</ulink>, whose source of payment for hospital care is more certain than is the case for many other emergency room patients.</simpara><simpara>To summarize, stories like these become possible when you use data to produce evidence to test independently allegations being made by sources who may have their own agendas. These stories also are a good example of the necessity for strong public records laws; the reason the government requires hospitals to report this data is so that these kinds of analyses can be done, whether by government, academics, investigators, or even citizen journalists. The subject of these stories is important because it examines whether millions of dollars of public money is being spent properly.</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>Steve Doig,  Walter Cronkite School of Journalism, Arizona State University</emphasis></simpara></sect1><sect1 id="_care_home_crisis"><title>Care Home Crisis</title><simpara>A <ulink url="http://on.ft.com/care-home-crisis">Financial Times investigation</ulink> into the private care home industry exposed how some private equity investors turned elderly care into a profit machine and highlighted the deadly human costs of a business model that favored investment returns over good care.</simpara><simpara>The analysis was timely, because the financial problems of Southern Cross, then the country’s largest care home operator, were coming to a head. The government had for decades promoted a privatization drive in the care sector and continued to tout the private sector for its astute business practices.</simpara><simpara>Our inquiry began with analyzing data we obtained from the UK regulator in charge of inspecting care homes. The information was public, but it required a lot of persistence to get the data in a form that was usable.</simpara><simpara>The data included ratings (now defunct) on individual homes’ performance and a breakdown of whether they were private, government-owned, or non-profit. The Care Quality Commission (CQC), up to June 2010, rated care homes on quality (0 stars = poor, to 3 stars = excellent).</simpara><simpara>The first step required extensive data cleaning, as the data provided by the Care Quality Commission for example contained categorizations that were not uniform. This was primarily done using Excel. We also determined—through desk and phone research—whether particular homes were owned by private-equity groups. Before the financial crisis, the care home sector was a magnet for private equity and property investors, but several—such as Southern Cross—had begun to face serious financial difficulties. We wanted to establish what effect, if any, private equity ownership had on quality of care.</simpara><simpara>A relatively straightforward set of Excel calculations enabled us to establish that the non-profit and government-run homes, on average, performed significantly better than the private sector. Some private equity-owned care home groups performed well over average, and others well below average.</simpara><simpara>Paired with on-the-ground reporting, case studies of neglect, an in-depth look at the failures in regulatory policies, as well as other data on levels of pay, turnover rates, etc., our analysis was able to paint a picture of the true state of elderly care.</simpara><simpara>Some tips:</simpara><itemizedlist><listitem><simpara>

But in 2011, after winning the elections, Argentina’s new government announced cuts in subsidies for public services starting December of the same year. At the same time the national government decided to transfer the administration of the local bus lines and metro lines to the City of Buenos Aires government. As the transfer of subsidies to this local government hasn’t been clarified and there was a lack of sufficient local funds to guarantee the safety of the transportation system, the government of the City of Buenos Aires rejected this decision.</simpara><simpara>As this was happening, I and my colleagues at La Nación were meeting for the first time to discuss how to start our own data journalism operation. Our Financial Section Editor suggested that the subsidies data published by the Secretaría de Transporte (the Department of Transportation; <ulink url="http://www.transporte.gov.ar/">http://www.transporte.gov.ar/</ulink>) would be a good challenge to start with, as it was very difficult to make sense of due to the format and the terminology.</simpara><simpara>The poor conditions of the public transportation system impact the life of more than 5,800,000 passengers every day. Delays, strikes, vehicle breakdowns, or even accidents are often happening. We thus decided to look into where the subsidies for the public transportation system in Argentina go and make this data easily accessible to all Argentinian citizens by means of a “Transport Subsidies Explorer,” which is currently in the making.</simpara><figure id="FIG0322" float="0"><title>The Transport Subsidies Explorer (La Nación)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 21 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0321.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0321.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><simpara>We started with calculating how much bus companies receive every month from the government.

We are using the resulting dataset with more than 285,000 records for our investigations and visualizations, in both print and online. Additionally, we are making this data available in machine-readable format for every Argentinian to reuse and share.</simpara><simpara>The next step was to identify how much the monthly maintenance of a public transport vehicle costed the government on average. To find this out we went to another government website, that of the Comisión Nacional de Regulación del Transporte (CNRT, or The National Commission for the Regulation of Transport;  <ulink url="http://www.cnrt.gov.ar/index2.htm">http://www.cnrt.gov.ar/index2.htm</ulink>), responsible for regulating transportation in Argentina. On this website, we found a list of bus companies that owned 9000 vehicles altogether. We developed a normalizer to allow us to reconcile bus company names and cross-reference the two datasets.</simpara><simpara>To proceed, we needed the registration number of each vehicle. On the CNRT website, we found a list of vehicles per bus line per company with their license plates. Vehicle registration numbers in Argentina are composed of letters and numbers that correspond to the vehicle’s age. For example, my car has the registration number IDF234, and the “I” corresponds to March-April 2011. We reverse engineered the license plates for buses belonging to all listed companies to find the average age of buses per company, in order to show how much money goes to each company and compare the amounts based on the average age of their vehicles.</simpara><simpara>In the middle of this process, the content of the government-released PDFs containing the data we needed mysteriously changed, although the URLs and names of the files remained the same. Some PDFs were now missing the vertical “totals,” making it impossible to cross-check totals across all the entire investigated time period, 2002-2011.</simpara><simpara>We took this case to a hackathon organized by Hacks/Hackers in Boston, where developer Matt Perry generously created what we call the “PDF Spy.” This application won the  “Most Intriguing” category in that event.

Between September and October 2011, a group of young residents of a small town located in north of the state of Minas Gerais, which is one of the poorest regions of Brazil, were trained in basic journalism techniques and budget monitoring. They also learned how to make Freedom of Information requests and access publicly available information from official databases on the Internet.</simpara><simpara>Januária, a town of approximately 65,000 residents, is also renowned for the failure of its local politicians. In three four-year terms, it had seven different mayors. Almost all of them were removed from office due to wrongdoing in their public administrations, including charges of corruption.</simpara><simpara>Small towns like Januária often fail to attract attention from the Brazilian media, which tends to focus on larger cities and state capitals. However, there is an opportunity for residents of small towns to become a potential ally in the monitoring of the public administration because they know the daily challenges facing their local communities better than anyone. With the Internet as another important ally, residents can now better access information such as budget and other local data.</simpara><figure id="FIG0325" float="0"><title>The Friends of Januária citizen media project teaches key skills to citizens to turn them into data journalists</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 24 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0324.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0324.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><simpara>After taking part in twelve workshops, some of the new citizen reporters from Januária began to demonstrate how this concept of accessing publicly available data in small towns can be put into practice. For example, Soraia Amorim, a 22 year-old citizen journalist, wrote a story about the number of doctors that are on the city payroll according to Federal Government data. However, she found that the official number did not correspond with the situation in the town. To write this piece, Soraia had access to health data, which is available online at the <ulink url="http://bit.ly/tabnet-datasus">website of the SUS (Sistema Único de Saúde or Unique Health System)</ulink>, a federal program that provides free medical assistance to the Brazilian population. According to SUS data, Januária should have 71 doctors in various health specialities.</simpara><simpara>The number of doctors indicated by SUS data did not match what Soraia knew about doctors in the area: residents were always complaining about the lack of doctors and some patients had to travel to neighboring towns to see one. Later, she interviewed a woman that had recently been in a motorcycle accident and could not find medical assistance at Januária’s hospital because no doctor was available. She also talked to the town’s Health Secretary, who admitted that there were less doctors in town than the number published by SUS.</simpara><simpara>These initial findings raise many questions about reasons for this difference between the official information published online and the town’s reality. One of them is that the federal data may be wrong, which would mean that there is an important lack of health information in Brazil. Another possibility may be that Januária is incorrectly reporting the information to SUS. Both of these possibilities should lead to a deeper investigation to find the definitive answer. However, Soraia’s story is an important part of this chain because it highlights an inconsistency and may also encourage others to look more closely at this issue.</simpara><simpara>“I used to live in the countryside, and finished high school with a lot of difficulty,” says Soraia. “When people asked me what I wanted to do with my life, I always told them that I wanted to be a journalist. But I imagined that it was almost impossible due to the world I lived in.” After taking part in the Friends of Januária training, Soraia believes that access to data is an important tool to change the reality of her town. “I feel able to help to change my town, my country, the world,” she adds.</simpara><simpara>Another citizen journalist from the project is 20 year-old Alysson Montiériton, who also used data for an article. It was during the project’s first class, when the citizen reporters walked around the city to look for subjects that could become stories, that Alysson decided to write about a broken traffic light located in a very important intersection, which had remained broken since the beginning of the year. After learning how to look for data on the Internet, he searched for the number of vehicles that exists in town and the amount of taxes paid by those who own cars.

What now? First of all you need some data. This section looks at where you can get it from. We learn how to find data on the web, how to request it using freedom of information laws, how to use “screen-scraping” to gather data from unstructured sources, and how to use “crowd-sourcing” to collect your own datasets from your readers. Finally we look at what the law says about republishing datasets, and how to use simple legal tools to let others reuse your data.</simpara><sect1 id="_a_five_minute_field_guide"><title>A Five Minute Field Guide</title><simpara>Looking for data on a particular topic or issue? Not sure what exists or where to find it? Don’t know where to start? In this section we look at how to get started with finding public data sources on the web.</simpara><sect2 id="_streamlining_your_search"><title>Streamlining Your Search</title><simpara>While they may not always be easy to find, many databases on the web are indexed by search engines, whether the publisher intended this or not. Here are a few tips:</simpara><itemizedlist><listitem><simpara>
When searching for data, make sure that you include both search terms relating to the content of the data you’re trying to find, as well as some information on the format or source that you would expect it to be in. Google and other search engines allow you to search by file type. For example, you can look only for spreadsheets (by appending your search with “filetype:XLS filetype:CSV”), geodata (“filetype:shp”), or database extracts (“filetype:MDB, filetype:SQL, filetype:DB”). If you’re so inclined, you can even look for PDFs (“filetype:pdf”).
</simpara></listitem><listitem><simpara>
You can also search by part of a URL. Googling for “inurl:downloads filetype:xls” will try to find all Excel files that have “downloads” in their web address (if you find a single download, it’s often worth just checking what other results exist for the same folder on the web server). You can also limit your search to only those results on a single domain name, by searching for “site:agency.gov”, for example.
</simpara></listitem><listitem><simpara>
Another popular trick is not to search for content directly, but for places where bulk data may be available. For example, “site:agency.gov Directory Listing” may give you some listings generated by the web server with easy access to raw files, while “site:agency.gov Database Download” will look for intentionally created listings.
</simpara></listitem></itemizedlist><?dbfo-need height="2in"?><sidebar><title>Going Straight to the Source</title><simpara>The first trick I use in getting hold of data that is held by a public entity is to try to go directly to the data holder, not the public affairs person, not through an FOIA. I could craft an FOIA or public records request of course, but it will start the wheels turning slowly. It’s likely that I’ll get a response back that the data is not in the format I requested, or (as has happened in some cases) that the governmental body uses a proprietary software and can’t extract the data in the format I requested. But, if I first successfully reach the person who handles data for that organization, I can ask questions about what data they keep on the subject and how they keep it. I can find out the format. I can speak data-language and find out what I need to know to successfully request the data. The roadblocks to this approach? Often, it’s hard to reach these people. The Public Information Officer (PIO) will want me to deal with them. I’ve found in those cases, it’s best to try to then set up a conference call, or even better, an in-person meeting with the PIO, the data guru, and me. And I can set it up in a way that makes it hard for them to say no. “I don’t want to create work for them,” I say. “I don’t want to create an unnecessarily burdensome or overly broad request, so a meeting will help me understand exactly what they have and how I can best request exactly what is needed.”</simpara><simpara>If this method does not work, my fallback is to ask first for their record layout and data dictionary in a request. Then, I actually request the data. I sometimes will also ask first how they keep the data, and in what system. That way, I can research the ways the data can be exported in advance of writing my request.</simpara><simpara>Lastly, my best success story comes from when I was working at a small newspaper in Montana. I needed some county data, which I was told could not be exported out of the mainframe. I did a little research, and offered to come in and help. I worked with the data person, we built a short script, and printed the data to a floppy disk (this was a long time ago). I had my data, and the county now was equipped to provide data to anyone who requested it. They didn’t intend for that to happen, but they needed to extract the data sometimes too and didn’t fully understand their system, so we all helped each other.</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>Cheryl Philips, The Seattle Times</emphasis></simpara></sidebar></sect2><sect2 id="_browse_data_sites_and_services"><title>Browse Data Sites and Services</title><simpara>Over the last few years, a number of dedicated data portals, data hubs, and other data sites have appeared on the web.

The previous chapter has some suggestions for where you might look. If you’ve looked around and still can’t get hold of the data you need, then you may wish to file a formal request. Here are some tips that may help to make your request more effective:</simpara><variablelist><varlistentry><term>
Plan ahead to save time
</term><listitem><simpara>
  Think about submitting a formal access request whenever you set out to look for information. It’s better not to wait until you have exhausted all other possibilities. You will save time by submitting a request at the beginning of your research and carrying out other investigations in parallel. Be prepared for delay: sometimes public bodies take a while to process requests, so it is better to expect this.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
Check the rules about fees
</term><listitem><simpara>
  Before you start submitting a request, check the rules about fees for either submitting requests or receiving information. That way, if a public official suddenly asks you for money, you will know what your rights are. You can ask for electronic documents to avoid copying and posting costs, mention in your request that you would prefer the information in electronic format. That way you will avoid paying a fee, unless of course the information is not available electronically, although these days, it’s usually possible to scan documents which are not already digitalized and then to send them as an attachment by email.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
Know your rights
</term><listitem><simpara>
  Find out what your rights are before you begin, so you know where you stand and what the public authorities are and are not obliged to do. For example, most freedom of information laws provide a time limit for authorities to reply to you. Globally, the range in most laws is from a few days to one month. Make sure that you know what this is before you set out, and make a note of when you submit your request.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry></variablelist><simpara>Governments are not obliged to process data for you, but should give you all the data they have, and if it is data that they should have in order to perform their legal competencies, they should certainly produce it for you.</simpara><variablelist><varlistentry><term>
Say that you know your rights
</term><listitem><simpara>
  Usually the law does not require that you mention the access to information law or freedom of information act, but this is recommended because it shows you know your legal rights and is likely to encourage correct processing of the requests according to the law. We note that for requests to the EU, it’s important to mention that it’s an access to documents request and it’s best to make a specific mention of Regulation 1049/2001.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
Keep it simple
</term><listitem><simpara>
  In all countries, it is better to start with a simple request for information and then to add more questions once you get the initial information. That way you don’t run the risk of the public institution applying an extension because it is a “complex request.”
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
Keep it focused
</term><listitem><simpara>
  A request for information only held by one part of a public authority will probably be answered more quickly than one which requires a search across the entire authority. A request which involves the authority in consulting third parties (e.g., a private company which supplied the information, another government which is affected by it) can take a particularly long time. Be persistent.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
Think inside the filing cabinet
</term><listitem><simpara>
  Try to find out what data is collated. For example, if you get a blank copy of the form the police fill out after traffic accidents, you can then see what information they do or do not record about car crashes.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
Be specific

  Before you submit your request, think: is it in any way ambiguous? This is especially important if you are planning to compare data from different public authorities. For example, if you ask for figures for <emphasis>the past three years</emphasis>, some authorities will send you information for the past three calendar years and others for the past three financial years, which you won’t be able to directly compare. If you decide to hide your real request in a more general one, then you should make your request broad enough so that it captures the information you want but not so broad as to be unclear or discourage a response. Specific and clear requests tend to get faster and better answers.

Submit multiple requests
</term><listitem><simpara>
  If you are unsure where to submit your request, there is nothing to stop you submitting the request with two, three, or more bodies at the same time. In some cases, the various bodies will give you different answers, but this can actually be helpful in giving you a fuller picture of the information available on the subject you are investigating.

Submit international requests
</term><listitem><simpara>
  Increasingly, requests can be submitted electronically, so it doesn’t matter where you live. Alternatively, if you do not live in the country where you want to submit the request, you can sometimes send the request to the embassy and they should transfer it to the competent public body. You will need to check with the relevant embassy first if they are ready to do this—sometimes the embassy staff will not have been trained in the right to information and if this seems to be the case, it’s safer to submit the request directly to the relevant public body.

Do a test run
</term><listitem><simpara>
  If you are planning to send the same request to many public authorities, start by sending an initial draft of the request to a few authorities as a pilot exercise. This will show you whether you are using the right terminology to obtain the material you want and whether answering your questions is feasible, so that you can then revise the request if necessary before sending it to everyone.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
Anticipate the exceptions
</term><listitem><simpara>
  If you think that exceptions might be applied to your request, then, when preparing your questions, separate the question about the potentially sensitive information from the other information that common sense would say should not fall under an exception. Then split your question in two and submit the two requests separately.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
Ask for access to the files
</term><listitem><simpara>
  If you live near where the information is held (e.g., in the capital where the documents are kept), you can also ask to inspect original documents. This can be helpful when researching information that might be held in a large number of documents that you’d like to have a look through. Such inspection should be free of charge and should be arranged at a time that is reasonable and convenient for you.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
Keep a record!
</term><listitem><simpara>
  Make your request in writing and save a copy or a record of it so that in the future you are able to demonstrate that your request was sent, in case you need to make an appeal against failure to answer. This also gives you evidence of submitting the request if you are planning to do a story on it.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
Make it public
</term><listitem><simpara>
  Speed up answers by making it public that you submitted a request: if you write or broadcast a story that the request has been submitted, it can put pressure on the public institution to process and respond to the request. You can update the information as and when you get a response to the request—or if the deadline passes and there is no response, you can make this into a news story as well. Doing this has the additional benefit of educating members of the public about the right of access to information and how it works in practice.

Involve colleagues
</term><listitem><simpara>
  If your colleagues are skeptical about the value of access to information requests, one of the best ways to convince them is to write a story based on information you obtained using an access to information law. Mentioning in the final article or broadcast piece that you used the law is also recommended as a way of enforcing its value and raising public awareness of the right.

  If you want to analyze, explore, or manipulate data using a computer, then you should explicitly ask for data in an electronic, machine-readable format. You may wish to clarify this by specifying, for example, that you require budgetary information in a format “suitable for analysis with accounting software.” You may also wish to explicitly ask for information in disaggregated or granular form.

At the beginning of 2010, there was talk from George Osborne that if he became chancellor, he would release the COINS database to facilitate greater transparency in the Treasury. At this time it seemed a good idea to investigate the data in and structure of COINS so I sent a few FOI requests, one for the <ulink url="http://bit.ly/wdtk-coins-1">schema of the database</ulink>, one for the guidance Treasury workers receive when <ulink url="http://bit.ly/wdtk-coins-2">they work with COINS</ulink>, and one for the Treasury <ulink url="http://bit.ly/wdtk-coins-3">contract with the database provider</ulink>. All of which resulted in publication of useful data. I also requested all the spending codes in the database, <ulink url="http://bit.ly/wdtk-coins-4">which was also published</ulink>. All of this helped to understand COINS when George Osborne became chancellor in May 2010 and published COINS in June 2010. The COINS data was used in a number of websites encouraging the public to investigate the data—including <ulink url="http://openspending.org/">OpenSpending.org</ulink> and the Guardian’s <ulink url="http://coins.guardian.co.uk/coins-explorer/search">Coins Data Explorer</ulink>.</simpara><simpara>After further investigation it seemed that a large part of the database was missing: the Whole of Government Accounts (WGA) which is 1,500 sets of accounts for public funded bodies. I used FOI to <ulink url="http://bit.ly/wdtk-coins-5">request the 2008/09 WGA data</ulink> but to no avail. I also asked for the report from the audit office for WGA—which I hoped would explain the reasons the WGA was not in a suitable state to be released.

However I wanted to make sure there was enough guidance to create the complete set of accounts for each of the 1,500 bodies included in the WGA exercise. This brings me on to the second way I used FOI: to ensure the data released under the UK transparency agenda is well-explained and contains what it should. I put in a FOI request for the <ulink url="http://bit.ly/wdtk-coins-7">full set of accounts for every public body included in WGA</ulink>.</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>Lisa Evans, the Guardian</emphasis></simpara></sidebar></sect1><sect1 id="_wobbing_works_use_it"><title>Wobbing Works.

Here are three examples illustrating the strengths and challenges of wobbing from my work as an investigative journalist.</simpara><sect2 id="_case_study_1_farm_subsidy"><title>Case Study 1: Farm Subsidy</title><simpara>Every year, EU pays almost €60 billion to farmers and the farming industry. Every year. This has been going on since late 1950s and the political narrative was that the subsidies help our poorest farmers. However a first FOI breakthrough in Denmark in 2004 indicated that this was just a narrative. The small farmers were struggling, as they so often complained about in private and in public, and in reality most of the money went to a few large landowners and to the agricultural industry. So obviously I wanted to know: is there a pattern across Europe?</simpara><simpara>In the summer of 2004, I asked the European Commission for the data. Every year in February, the Commission receives data from the member states. The data shows who applies for EU funding, how much beneficiaries get, and whether they get it for farming their land, developing their region, or for exporting milk powder. At that time, the Commission received the figures as CSV files on a CD. A lot of data, but in principle easy to work with. If you could get it out, that is.</simpara><simpara>In 2004 the Commission refused to release the data; the key argument was that the data was uploaded into a database and couldn’t be retrieved without a lot of work. An argument that the European Ombudsmand called <emphasis>maladministration</emphasis>. You can find all documents in this case <ulink url="http://bit.ly/eu-wobbing">on the wobbing.eu website</ulink>. Back in 2004, we did not have the time to be legal foodies.

Not necessarily. Looking at the bigger political picture, the farm subsidies at the time had to be seen in the context of the WTO negotiations where subsidies were under pressure. Denmark and the UK are amongst the more liberal countries in Europe, so there may well have been political winds blowing into the direction of transparency in those countries.</simpara><simpara>The story did not stop there; for more episodes and for the data, see <ulink url="http://farmsubsidy.org/">http://farmsubsidy.org/</ulink>.</simpara><simpara>Lesson: go wob-shopping.

Prior to that, almost nothing was accessible to the public. The idea was to get the original government records and to put the data in spreadsheets, to run basic checks and comparisons among the municipalities and to get maximum and minimum figures. Basic indicators were budget numbers, regular and special expenses, salaries of officials, travel expenses, numbers of employees, cell phone expenses, per diems, public procurement figures, and so on. It was the first time that reporters had asked for such
information.</simpara><simpara>The result was a comprehensive database that unravels numerous phony representations, malfeasances, and corruption cases. A list of the highest-paid mayors indicated that a few of them were receiving more money than the Serbian president. Many other officials were overpaid, with many receiving enormous travel repayments and per diems. Our hard-earned public procurement data helped to highlight an official mess. More than 150 stories came out of the database and many of them were picked up by the local and national media in Serbia.</simpara><simpara>We learned that comparing the records with the comparable data from similar government

There are many types of tags that perform different functions—some produce boxes—others tables, images, or links.

from lxml import html</screen><simpara>In this first section, we’re importing existing functionality from libraries—snippets of pre-written code. <literal moreinfo="none">scraperwiki</literal> will give us the ability to download websites, while <literal moreinfo="none">lxml</literal> is a tool for the structured analysis of HTML documents. Good news: if you are writing a Python scraper with ScraperWiki, these two lines will always be the same.</simpara><screen format="linespecific">url = "http://www-news.iaea.org/EventList.aspx"
doc_text = scraperwiki.scrape(url)
doc = html.fromstring(doc_text)</screen><simpara>Next, the code makes a name (variable): <literal moreinfo="none">url</literal>, and assigns the URL of the IAEA page as its value. This tells the scraper that this thing exists and we want to pay attention to it. Note that the URL itself is in quotes as it is not part of the program code but a <emphasis>string</emphasis>, a sequence of characters.</simpara><simpara>We then use the <literal moreinfo="none">url</literal> variable as input to a function, <literal moreinfo="none">scraperwiki.scrape</literal>. A function will provide some defined job—in this case, it’ll download a web page. When it’s finished, it’ll assign its output to another variable, <literal moreinfo="none">doc_text</literal>. <literal moreinfo="none">doc_text</literal> will now hold the actual text of the website; not the visual form you see in your browser, but the source code, including all the tags. Since this form is not very easy to parse, we’ll use another function, <literal moreinfo="none">html.fromstring</literal>, to generate a special representation where we can easily address elements, the so-called document object model (DOM).</simpara><screen format="linespecific">for row in doc.cssselect("#tblEvents tr"):
link_in_header = row.cssselect("h4 a").pop()
event_title = link_in_header.text
print event_title</screen><simpara>In this final step, we use the DOM to find each row in our table and extract the event’s title from its header. Two new concepts are used: the for loop and element selection (<literal moreinfo="none">.cssselect</literal>). The for loop essentially does what its name implies; it will traverse a list of items, assigning each a temporary alias (<literal moreinfo="none">row</literal> in this case) and then run any indented instructions for each item.</simpara><simpara>The other new concept, element selection, is making use of a special language to find elements in the document. CSS selectors are normally used to add layout information to HTML elements and can be used to precisely pick an element out of a page. In this case (line 6) we’re selecting <literal moreinfo="none">#tblEvents tr</literal>, which will match each <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;tr&gt;</literal> within the table element with the ID <literal moreinfo="none">tblEvents</literal> (the hash simply signifies ID). Note that this will return a list of <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;tr&gt;</literal> elements.</simpara><simpara>That can be seen on the next line (line 7), where we’re applying another selector to find any <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;a&gt;</literal> (which is a hyperlink) within a <literal moreinfo="none">&lt;h4&gt;</literal> (a title). Here we only want to look at a single element (there’s just one title per row), so we have to <literal moreinfo="none">pop</literal> it off the top of the list returned by our selector with the <literal moreinfo="none">.pop()</literal> function.</simpara><simpara>Note that some elements in the DOM contain actual text (i.e., text that is not part of any markup language), which we can access using the <literal moreinfo="none">[element].text</literal> syntax seen on line 8. Finally, in line 9, we’re printing that text to the ScraperWiki console. If you hit run in your scraper, the smaller window should now start listing the event’s names from the IAEA website.</simpara><figure id="FIG046" float="none"><title>A scraper in action (ScraperWiki)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 5 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0405.pdf" format="PDF" scale="90"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0405.png" format="PNG" scale="90"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><?dbfo-need height="1in"?><simpara>You can now see a basic scraper operating: it downloads the web page, transforms it into the DOM form, and then allows you to pick and extract certain content.

Whois

  If you go to <ulink url="http://whois.domaintools.com/">http://whois.domaintools.com/</ulink> (or just type whois <emphasis>www.example.com</emphasis> in Terminal.app on a Mac, with a URL in place of the placeholder here) you can get the basic registration information for any website. In recent years, some owners have chosen private registration, which hides their details from view, but in many cases you’ll see a name, address, email, and phone number for the person who registered the site. You can also enter numerical IP addresses here and get data on the organization or individual that owns that server. This is especially handy when you’re trying to track down more information on an abusive or malicious user of a service, since most websites record an IP address for everyone who accesses them.

Blekko
</term><listitem><simpara>
  The <ulink url="http://blekko.com/">Blekko search engine</ulink> offers an unusual amount of insight into the internal statistics it gathers on sites as it crawls the Web. If you type in a domain name followed by “/seo”, you’ll receive a page of information on that URL.
  The first tab in <xref linkend="FIG048"/> shows you which other sites are linking to the domain in popularity order. This can be extremely useful when you’re trying to understand what coverage a site is receiving, and if you want to understand why it’s ranking highly in Google’s search results, since they’re based on those inbound links. <xref linkend="FIG049"/> tells you which other websites are running from the same machine. It’s common for scammers and spammers to astroturf their way towards legitimacy by building multiple sites that review and link to each other. They look like independent domains, and may even have different registration details, but they’ll often actually live on the same server because that’s a lot cheaper. These statistics give you an insight into the hidden business structure of the site you’re researching.

  By surveying a cross-section of American consumers, <ulink url="http://www.compete.com/">http://www.compete.com/</ulink> builds up detailed usage statistics for most websites, and makes some basic details freely available. Choose the Site Profile tab and enter a domain (<xref linkend="FIG0410"/>). You’ll then see a graph of the site’s traffic over the last year, together with figures for how many people visited, and how often (as in <xref linkend="FIG0411"/>). Since they’re based on surveys, the numbers are only approximate, but I’ve found them reasonably accurate when I’ve been able to compare them against internal analytics. In particular, they seem to be a good source when comparing two sites, since while the absolute numbers may be off for both, it’s still a good representation of their relative difference in popularity. They only survey US consumers though, so the data will be poor for predominantly international sites.

Google’s Site Search
</term><listitem><simpara>
  One feature that can be extremely useful when you’re trying to explore all the content on a particular domain is the “site:” keyword. If you add “site:example.com” to your search phrase, Google will only return results from the site you’ve specified. You can even narrow it down further by including the prefix of the pages you’re interested in, for example, “site:example.com/pages/”, and you’ll only see results that match that pattern. This can be extremely useful when you’re trying to find information that domain owners may have made publicly available but aren’t keen to publicize, so picking the right keywords can uncover some very revealing material.

Bit.ly
</term><listitem><simpara>
  I always turn to <ulink url="http://bitly.com/">bit.ly</ulink> when I want to know how people are sharing a particular link with each other. To use it, enter the URL you’re interested in. Then click on the Info Page+ link. That takes you to the full statistics page (though you may need to choose “aggregrate bit.ly link” first if you’re signed in to the service). This will give you an idea of how popular the page is, including activity on Facebook and Twitter, and below that you’ll see public conversations about the link provided by backtype.com. I find this combination of traffic data and conversations very helpful when I’m trying to understand why a site or page is popular, and who exactly its fans are. For example, it provided me with strong evidence that the prevailing narrative about grassroots sharing and Sarah Palin was wrong.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry></variablelist><?dbfo-need height="1in"?><variablelist><varlistentry><term>
Twitter
</term><listitem><simpara>
  As the micro-blogging service becomes more widely used, it becomes more useful as a gauge of how people are sharing and talking about individual pieces of content. It’s deceptively simple to discover public conversations about a link. You just paste the URL you’re interested in into the search box, and then possibly hit “more tweets” to see the full set of results.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
Google’s Cache
</term><listitem><simpara>
  When a page becomes controversial, the publishers may take it down or alter it without acknowledgment. If you suspect you’re running into the problem, the first place to turn is Google’s cache of the page as it was when it did its last crawl. The frequency of crawls is constantly increasing, so you’ll have the most luck if you try this within a few hours of the suspected changes. Enter the target URL in Google’s search box, and then click the triple arrow on the right of the result for that page. A graphical preview should appear, and if you’re lucky, there will be a small “Cache” link at the top of it. Click that to see Google’s snapshot of the page. If that has trouble loading, you can switch over to the more primitive text-only page by clicking another link at the top of the full cache page. You’ll want to take a screenshot or copy-paste any relevant content you do find, since it may be invalidated at any time by a subsequent crawl.

The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine
</term><listitem><simpara>
  If you need to know how a particular page has changed over a longer time period, like months or years, the Internet Archive runs a service called <ulink url="http://archive.org/web/web.php">The Wayback Machine</ulink> that periodically takes snapshots of the most popular pages on the web. You go to the site, enter the link you want to research, and if it has any copies, it will show you a calendar so you can pick the time you’d like to examine. It will then present a version of the page roughly as it was at that point. It will often be missing styling or images, but it’s usually enough to understand what the focus of that page’s content was then.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
View Source
</term><listitem><simpara>
  It’s a bit of a long shot, but developers often leave comments or other clues in the HTML code that underlies any page. It will be on different menus depending on your browser, but there’s always a “View source” option that will let you browse the raw HTML. You don’t need to understand what the machine-readable parts mean, just keep an eye out for the pieces of text that are often scattered amongst them. Even if they’re just copyright notices or mentions of the author’s names, these can often give important clues about the creation and purpose of the page.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
TinEye
</term><listitem><simpara>
  Sometimes you really want to know the source of an image, but without clear attribution text there’s no obvious way to do this with traditional search engines like Google. <ulink url="http://www.tineye.com/">TinEye</ulink> offers a specialized “reverse image search” process, where you give it the image you have, and it finds other pictures on the web that look very similar. Because they use image recognition to do the matching, it even works when a copy has been cropped, distorted, or compressed. This can be extremely effective when you suspect that an image that’s being passed off as original or new is being misrepresented, since it can lead back to the actual source.

YouTube
</term><listitem><simpara>
  If you click on the Statistics icon to the lower right of any video, you can get a rich set of information about its audience over time. While it’s not complete, it is useful for understanding roughly who the viewers are, where they are coming from, and when.

There isn’t a good off-the-shelf tool available to help with this, but it can be very helpful to know the basics about the hidden headers included in every email message. These work like postmarks, and can reveal a surprising amount about the sender. In particular, they often include the IP address of the machine that the email was sent from, a lot like caller ID on a phone call. You can then run whois on that IP number to find out which organization owns that machine. If it turns out to be someone like Comcast or AT&amp;T who provide connections to consumers, then you can visit MaxMind to get its approximate location.</simpara><simpara>To view these headers in Gmail, open the message and open the menu next to reply on the top right and choose “Show original”.</simpara><simpara>You’ll then see a new page revealing the hidden content. There will be a couple of dozen lines at the start that are words followed by a colon. The IP address you’re after may be in one of these, but its name will depend on how the email was sent.

  If you’re interested in knowing how public interest in a topic or person has varied over time, you can actually get day-by-day viewing figures for any page on Wikipedia at <ulink url="http://stats.grok.se/">http://stats.grok.se/</ulink>. This site is a bit rough and ready, but will let you uncover the information you need with a bit of digging. Enter the name you’re interested in to get a monthly view of the traffic on that page. That will bring up a graph showing how many times the page was viewed for each day in the month you specify. Unfortunately you can only see one month at a time, so you’ll have to select a new month and search again to see longer-term changes.

Enter a couple of common search phrases, like “Justin Bieber vs Lady Gaga”, and you’ll see a graph of their relative number of searches over time. There’s a lot of options for refining your view of the data, from narrower geographic areas, to more detail over time. The only disappointment is the lack of absolute values—you only get relative percentages, which can be hard to interpret.

It looks like it is going to be bigger than the British crime survey in terms of how many people come back to it, which is brilliant.</simpara><simpara>What both of these projects have in common is that they are about issues that people really care about, so they are willing to spend time on them. A lot of the crowdsourcing we have done relies on help from obsessives. With the MPs’ expenses, we had a massive amount of traffic at the beginning and it really died down. But we still have people that are obsessively going through every page looking for anomalies and stories. One person has done 30,000 pages. They know a lot of stuff.</simpara><simpara>We also used crowdsourcing with the <ulink url="http://bit.ly/guardian-palin-papers">Sarah Palin papers</ulink>. Again this was a great help in scouring the raw information for stories.</simpara><simpara>In terms of generating stories crowdsourcing has worked really well for us. People really liked it and it made the Guardian look good. But in terms of generating data, we haven’t used crowdsourcing so much.</simpara><simpara>Some of the crowdsourcing projects that we’ve done that have worked really well have been more like old-fashioned surveys. When you are asking people about their experience, about their lives, about what they’ve done, they work very well because people aren’t as likely to make that up. They will say what they feel. When we asked people to kind of do our job for us, you have to find a framework for people to produce the data in a way you can trust them.</simpara><simpara>Regarding the reliability of data, I think the approach that <ulink url="http://www.oldweather.org/">Old Weather</ulink> have got is really good. They get ten people to do each entry, which is a good way to ensure accuracy. With the MPs’ expenses, we tried to minimize the risk of MPs going online and editing their own records to make themselves look better. But you can’t permanently guard against this. You can only really look out for certain URLs or if it’s coming from the SW1 area of London. So that’s a bit trickier. The data we were getting out was not always reliable. Even though stories were great, it wasn’t producing raw numbers that we could confidently use.</simpara><simpara>If I were to give advice to aspiring data journalists who want to use crowdsourcing to collect data, I would encourage them do this on something that people really care about, and will continue to care about when it stops making front page headlines. Also if you make something more like a game, this can really help to engage people. When we did the expenses story a second time, it was much more like a game with individual tasks for people to do. It really helped to give people specific tasks. That made a big difference because I think if you just present people with the mountain of information to go through and say “go through this,” it can make for hard and rather unrewarding work.

So we added some caveats: Guardian readers may be more wealthy than other people, people who got less than they expected might be more willing to talk to us, and so on.</simpara><simpara>We didn’t know how much value the results would have. We ended up having a good seven thousand records to base our piece on, and we found that about half the people who’d asked for tickets had got nothing. We ran all of this stuff and because so many people had taken part the day before, there was a lot of interest in the results.</simpara><simpara>A few weeks later, the official summary report came out, and our numbers were shockingly close. They were almost exactly spot-on. I think partly through luck, but also because we got just so many people to respond.</simpara><simpara>If you start asking your readers about something like this on a comments thread, you will be limited in what you can do with the results. So you have to start by thinking, “What is the best tool for what I want to know?” Is it a comment thread? Or is it building an app? And if it is building an app, you have to think “Is this worth the wait? And is it worth the resources that are required to do it?”</simpara><simpara>In this case, we thought of Google Forms. If someone fills in the form, you can see the result as a row on a spreadsheet. This meant that even if it was still updating, even if results were still coming in, I could open up the spreadsheet and see all of the results straight away.</simpara><simpara>I could have tried to do the work in Google, but I downloaded it into Microsoft Excel and then did things like sort it from low to high; I also found the entries where people had written out numbers (instead of putting digits) for how much they spent, and fixed all of those. I decided to exclude as little as I could. So rather than taking only valid responses, I tried to fix what I had. Some people had used foreign currencies, so I converted them to sterling, all of which was a bit painstaking.</simpara><simpara>But the whole analysis was done in a few hours, and I knocked out the obviously silly entries. A lot of people decided to point out that they spent nothing on tickets. That’s a bit facetious, but fine. That was less than a hundred out of over seven thousand entries.</simpara><simpara>Then there were a few dozen who put in obviously fake high amounts to try to distort the results. Things like ten million pounds. So that left me with a set that I could use with the normal data principles we use every day. I did what’s called a “pivot table.” I did some averaging. That kind of thing.</simpara><simpara>We didn’t have any idea how much momentum the project would have, so it was just me working with the Sports blog editor. We put our heads together and thought this might be a fun project. We did it, start to finish, in 24 hours. We had the idea, we put something up at lunchtime, we put it on the front of the site, we saw it was proving quite popular, we kept it on the front of the site for the rest of the day, and we presented the results online the next morning.</simpara><simpara>We decided to use Google Docs because it gives complete control over the results. I didn’t have to use anyone else’s analytic tools. I can put it easily into a database software or into spreadsheets. When you start using specialist polling software, you are often restricted to using their tools. If the information we’d been asking for was particularly sensitive, we might have hesitated before using Google and thought about doing something “in-house.” But generally, it is very easy to drop a Google Form into a Guardian page and it’s virtually invisible to the user that we are using one. So it is very convenient.</simpara><simpara>In terms of advice for data journalists who want to use crowdsourcing, you have to have very specific things you want to know. Ask things that get multiple choice responses as much as possible. Try to get some basic demographics of who you are talking to so you can see if your sample might be biased. If you are asking for amounts and things like this, try in the guidance to specify that it’s in digits, that they have to use a specific currency, and things like that. A lot won’t, but the more you hold their hand throughout, the better. And always, always, add a comment box because a lot of people will fill out the other fields but what they really want is to give you their opinion on the story. Especially on a consumer story or an outrage.</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>Marianne Bouchart, Data Journalism Blog, interviewing James Ball, the Guardian</emphasis></simpara></sect1><sect1 id="_using_and_sharing_data_the_black_letter_the_fine_print_and_reality"><title>Using and Sharing Data: the Black Letter, the Fine Print, and Reality</title><simpara>In this section we’ll have a quick look at the state of the law with respect to data and databases, and what you can do to open up your data using readily available public licenses and legal tools. Don’t let any of the following dampen your enthusiasm for data-driven journalism. Legal restrictions on data usually won’t get in your way, and you can easily make sure they won’t get in the way of others using data you’ve published.</simpara><simpara>To state the obvious, obtaining data has never been easier. Before the widespread publishing of data on the Web, even if you had identified a dataset you needed, you’d need to ask whoever had a copy to make it accessible to you, possibly involving paper and the post or a personal visit. Now, you have your computer ask their computer to send a copy to your computer. Conceptually similar, but you have a copy right now, and they (the creator or publisher) haven’t done anything, and probably have no idea that you have downloaded a copy.</simpara><simpara>What about downloading data with a program (sometimes called “scraping”) and terms of service (ToS)? Consider the previous paragraph: your browser is just such a program. Might ToS permit access by only certain kinds of programs? If you have inordinate amounts of time and money to spend reading such documents and perhaps asking a lawyer for advice, by all means, do. But usually, just don’t be a jerk: if your program hammers a site, your network may well get blocked from accessing the site in question—and perhaps you will have deserved it. There is now a large body of practice around accessing and scraping data from the web. If you plan to do this, reading about examples at a site like ScraperWiki will give you a head start.</simpara><simpara>Once you have some data of interest, you can query, pore over, sort, visualize, correlate, and perform any other kind of analysis you like using your copy of the data. You can publish your analysis, which can cite any data. There’s a lot to the catchphrase “facts are free” (as in free speech), but maybe this is only a catchphrase among those who think too much about the legalities of databases, or even more broadly (and more wonkily), data governance.</simpara><simpara>What if, being a good or aspiring-to-be-good data-driven journalist, you intend to publish not just your analysis, including some facts or data points, but also the datasets/databases you used—and perhaps added to—in conducting your analysis? Or maybe you’re just curating data and haven’t done any analysis (good: the world needs data curators). If you’re using data collected by some other entity, there could be a hitch. (If your database is wholly assembled by you, read the next paragraph anyway as motivation for the sharing practices in the next next paragraph.)</simpara><simpara>If you’re familiar with how copyright restricts creative works—if the copyright holder hasn’t given permission to use a work (or the work is in the public domain or your use might be covered by exceptions and limitations such as fair use) and you use—distribute, perform, etc.—the work anyway, the copyright holder could force you to stop. Although facts are free, collections of facts can be restricted very similarly, though there’s more variation in the relevant laws than there is for copyright as applied to creative works. Briefly, a database can be subject to copyright, as a creative work. In many jurisdictions, by the “sweat of the brow,” merely assembling a database, even in an uncreative fashion, makes the database subject to copyright. In the United States in particular, there tends to be a higher minimum of creativity for copyright to apply (Feist v. Rural, a case about a phone book, is the U.S. classic if you want to look it up). But in some jurisdictions there are also “database rights” that restrict databases, separate from copyright (though there is lots of overlap in terms of what is covered, in particular where creativity thresholds for copyright are nearly nonexistent). The best known of such are the European Union’s <emphasis>sui generis</emphasis> database rights. Again, especially if you’re in Europe, you may want to make sure you have permission before publishing a database from some other entity.</simpara><simpara>Obviously such restrictions aren’t the best way to grow an ecosystem of data-driven journalism (nor are they good for society at large—social scientists and others told the EU they wouldn’t be before <emphasis>sui generis</emphasis> came about, and studies since have shown them to be right). Fortunately, as a publisher of a database, you can remove such restrictions from the database (assuming it doesn’t have elements that you don’t have permission to grant further permissions around), essentially by granting permission in advance. You can do this by releasing your database under a public license or public domain dedication—just as many programmers release their code under a free and open source license, so that others can build on their code (as data-driven journalism often involves code, not just data, of course you should release your code too, so that your data collection and analysis are reproducible). There are lots of reasons for opening up your data. For example, your audience might create new visualizations or applications with it that you can link to—as the Guardian does with their data visualization Flickr pool. Your datasets can be combined with other datasets to give you and your readers greater insight into a topic. Things that others do with your data might give you leads for new stories, or ideas for stories, or ideas for other data-driven projects. And they will certainly bring you kudos.</simpara><figure id="FIG0415" float="none"><title>Open Data badges (Open Knowledge Foundation)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 14 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0414.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0414.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><simpara>When one realizes that releasing works under public licenses is a necessity, the question becomes, which license? That tricky question will frequently be answered by the project or community whose work you’re building on, or that you hope to contribute your work to—use the license they use. If you need to dig deeper, start from the set of licenses that are free and open—meaning that anyone has permission, for any use (attribution and sharing alike might be required). What the Free Software Definition and Open Source Definition do for software, the <ulink url="http://opendefinition.org/">Open Knowledge Definition</ulink> does for all other knowledge, including databases: define what makes a work open, and what open licenses allow users to do.</simpara><simpara>You can visit the Open Knowledge Definition website to see the <ulink url="http://opendefinition.org/licenses/">current set of licenses which qualify</ulink>. In summary, there are basically three classes of open licenses:</simpara><variablelist><varlistentry><term>
Public domain dedications
</term><listitem><simpara>
  These also serve as maximally permissive licenses; there are no conditions put upon using the work.

  Giving credit is the only substantial condition of these licenses.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
Copyleft, reciprocal, or share-alike licenses
</term><listitem><simpara>
  These also require that modified works, if published, be shared under the same license.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry></variablelist><simpara>Note if you’re using a dataset published by someone else under an open license, consider the above paragraph a very brief guide as to how to fulfill the conditions of that open license. The licenses you’re most likely to encounter, from Creative Commons, Open Data Commons, and various governments, usually feature a summary that will easily allow you to see what the substantial conditions are. Typically the license will be noted on a web page from which a dataset may be downloaded (or “scraped”, as of course, web pages can contain datasets) or in a conspicuous place within the dataset itself, depending on format. This marking is what you should do as well, when you open up your datasets.</simpara><simpara>Going back to the beginning, what if the dataset you need to obtain is still not available online, or behind a some kind of access control? Consider, in addition to asking for access yourself, requesting that the data to be opened up for the world to reuse. You could give some pointers to some of the great things that can happen with their data if they do this.</simpara><simpara>Sharing with the world might bring to mind that privacy and other considerations and regulations might come into play for some datasets. Indeed, just because open data lowers many technical and copyright and copyright-like barriers, doesn’t mean you don’t have to follow other applicable laws. But that’s as it always was, and there are tremendous resources and sometimes protections for journalists should your common sense indicate a need to investigate those.</simpara><simpara>Good luck! But in all probability you’ll need more of it for other areas of your project than you’ll need for managing the (low) legal risks.</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>Mike Linksvayer, Creative Commons</emphasis></simpara></sect1></chapter><chapter id="_understanding_data"><title>Understanding Data</title><informalfigure role="informal" float="0"><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_05in01.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_05in01.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></informalfigure><?dbfo-need height="1in"?><simpara>Once you’ve got your data, what do you do with it?

The best tip for handling data is to enjoy yourself. Data can appear forbidding. But allow it to intimidate you and you’ll get nowhere. Treat it as something to play with and explore and it will often yield secrets and stories with surprising ease. So handle it simply as you’d handle other evidence, without fear or favor. In particular, think of this as an exercise in imagination. Be creative by thinking of the alternative stories that might be consistent with the data and explain it better, then test them against more evidence. “What other story could explain this?” is a handy prompt to think about how this number, this obviously big or bad number, this clear proof of this or that, might be nothing of the sort.
</simpara></listitem><listitem><simpara>
Don’t confuse skepticism about data with cynicism. Skepticism is good; cynicism has simply thrown up its hands and quit. If you believe in data journalism (and you probably do, or you wouldn’t be reading this book), then you must believe that data has something far better to offer than the lies and damned lies of caricature or the killer facts of swivel-eyed headlines. Data often gives us profound knowledge, if used carefully. We need to be neither cynical nor naive, but alert.

If I tell you that drinking has gone up during the recession, you might tell me it’s because everyone is depressed. If I tell you that drinking is down, you might tell me it’s because everyone is broke. In other words, what the data says makes no difference to the interpretation that you are determined to put on it, namely that things are terrible one way or the other. If it goes up, it’s bad; if it goes down, it’s bad. The point here is that if you believe in data, try to let it speak before you slap on your own mood, beliefs, or expectations. There’s so much data about that you will often be able to find confirmation of your prior beliefs if you simply look around a bit. In other words, data journalism, to me at least, adds little value if you are not open-minded. It is only as objective as you strive to make it, and not by virtue of being based on numbers.

Uncertainty is OK. We associate numbers with authority and certainty. Often as not, the answer is that there is no answer, or the answer may be the best we have but still wouldn’t hit a barn door for accuracy. I think we should say these things. If that sounds like a good way of killing stories, I’d argue that it’s a great way of raising new questions. Equally, there can often be more than one legitimate way of cutting the data. Numbers don’t have to be either true or false.

The investigation is a story. The story of how you tried to find out can make great journalism, as you go from one piece of evidence to another—and this applies in spades to the evidence from data, where one number will seldom do. Different sources provide new angles, new ideas, and richer understanding. I wonder if we’re too hung up on wanting to be authoritative and tell people the answer—and so we miss a trick by not showing the sleuthing.

The best questions are the old ones: is that really a big number? Where did it come from? Are you sure it counts what you think it counts?

You ask questions of the data and get it to reveal the answers. But just as a source can only give answers about which he has information, a dataset can only answer questions for which it has the right records and the proper variables. This means that you should consider carefully what questions you need to answer even before you acquire your data. Basically, you work backward. First, list the data-evidenced statements you want to make in your story. Then decide which variables and records you would have to acquire and analyze in order to make those statements.</simpara><simpara>Consider an example involving local crime reports. Let’s say you want to do a story looking at crime patterns in your city, and the statements you want to make involve the times of day and the days of a week in which different kinds of crimes are most likely to happen, as well as what parts of town are hot spots for various crime categories.</simpara><simpara>You would realize that your data request has to include the date and the time each crime was reported, the kind of crime (murder, theft, burglary, etc.) as well as the address of where the crime occurred. So Date, Time, Crime Category, and Address are the minimum variables you need to answer those questions.</simpara><simpara>But be aware that there are a number of potentially interesting questions that this four-variable dataset <emphasis>can’t</emphasis> answer, like the race and gender of victims, or the total value of stolen property, or which officers are most productive in making arrests. Also, you may only be able to get records for a certain time period, like the past three years, which would mean you couldn’t say anything about whether crime patterns have changed over a longer period of time. Those questions may be outside of the planned purview of your story, and that’s fine. But you don’t want to get into your data analysis and suddenly decide you need to know what percentage of crimes in different parts of town are solved by arrest.</simpara><simpara>One lesson here is that it’s often a good idea to request <emphasis>all</emphasis> the variables and records in the database, rather than the subset that could answer the questions for the immediate story. (In fact, getting all the data can be cheaper than getting a subset, if you have to pay the agency for the programming necessary to write out the subset.) You can always subset the data on your own, and having access to the full dataset will let you answer new questions that may come up in your reporting and even produce new ideas for follow-up stories. It may be that confidentiality laws or other policies mean that some variables, such as the identities of victims or the names of confidential informants, can’t be released. But even a partial database is much better than none, as long as you understand which questions the redacted database can and can’t answer.</simpara></sect2><sect2 id="_cleaning_messy_data"><title>Cleaning Messy Data</title><simpara>One of the biggest problems in database work is that often you will be using data for analysis reasons that has been gathered for bureaucratic reasons. The problem is that the standard of accuracy for those two is quite different.</simpara><simpara>For example, a key function of a criminal justice system database is to make sure that defendant Jones is brought from the jail to be in front of Judge Smith at the time of his hearing. For that purpose, it really doesn’t matter a lot if Jones’ birth date is incorrect, or that his street address is misspelled, or even if his middle initial is wrong. Generally, the system still can use this imperfect record to get Jones to Smith’s courtroom at the appointed time.</simpara><simpara>But such errors can skew a data journalist’s attempts to discover the patterns in the database. For that reason, the first big piece of work to undertake when you acquire a new dataset is to examine how messy it is and then clean it up. A good quick way to look for messiness is to create frequency tables of the categorical variables, the ones that would be expected to have a relatively small number of different values. (When using Excel, for instance, you can do this by using Filter or Pivot Tables on each categorical variable.)</simpara><simpara>Take “Gender,” an easy example. You may discover that your Gender field includes any of a mix of values like these: Male, Female, M, F, 1, 0, MALE, FEMALE, etc., including misspellings like “Femal”. To do a proper gender analysis, you must standardize—decide on M and F, perhaps—and then change all the variations to match the standards. Another common database with these kinds of problems are American campaign finance records, where the Occupation field might list “Lawyer,” “Attorney,” “Atty,” “Counsel,” “Trial Lawyer,” and any of a wealth of variations and misspellings; again, the trick is to standardize the occupation titles into a shorter list of possibilities.</simpara><simpara>Data cleanup gets even more problematic when working with names. Are “Joseph T. Smith”, “Joseph Smith,” “J.T. Smith,” “Jos. Smith,” and “Joe Smith” all the same person? It may take looking at other variables like address or date of birth, or even deeper research in other records, to decide. But tools like Google Refine can make the cleanup and standardization task faster and less tedious.</simpara><sidebar><title>Dirty Data</title><simpara>Thanks to the generally strong public records laws in the United States, getting data here isn’t as big a problem as it can be in many other countries. But once we get it, we still face the problems of working with data that has been gathered for bureaucratic reasons, not for analytic reasons. The data often is “dirty,” with values that aren’t standardized. Several times I have received data that doesn’t match up to the supposed file layout and data dictionary that accompanies it. Some agencies will insist on giving you the data in awkward formats like .pdf, which have to be converted. Problems like these make you appreciate it when you do get an occasional no-hassle dataset.</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>Steve Doig, Walter Cronkite School of Journalism, Arizona State University</emphasis></simpara></sidebar></sect2><sect2 id="_data_may_have_undocumented_features"><title>Data May Have Undocumented Features</title><simpara>The Rosetta Stone of any database is the so-called data dictionary. Typically, this file (it may be text or PDF or even a spreadsheet) will tell you how the data file is formatted (delimited text, fixed width text, Excel, dBase, etc.), the order of the variables, the names of each variable, and the datatype of each variable (text string, integer, decimal, etc.) You will use this information to help you properly import the data file into the analysis software you intend to use (Excel, Access, SPSS, Fusion Tables, any of various flavors of SQL, etc.)</simpara><simpara>The other key element of a data dictionary is an explanation of any codes being used by particular variables. For instance, Gender may be coded so that “1=Male” and “0=Female.” Crimes may be coded by your jurisdiction’s statute numbers for each kind of crime. Hospital treatment records may use any of hundreds of 5-digit codes for the diagnoses of the conditions for which a patient is being treated. Without the data dictionary, these datasets could be difficult or even impossible to analyze properly.</simpara><simpara>But even with a data dictionary in hand, there can be problems. An example happened to reporters at the Miami Herald in Florida some years ago when they were doing an analysis of the varying rates of punishment that different judges were giving to people arrested for driving while intoxicated. The reporters acquired the conviction records from the court system and analyzed the numbers in the three different punishment variables in the data dictionary: amount of prison time given, amount of jail time given, and amount of fine given. These numbers varied quite a bit amongst the judges, giving the reporters’ evidence for a story about how some judges were harsh and some were lenient.</simpara><simpara>But for every judge, about 1-2 percent of the cases showed no prison time, no jail time, and no fine. So the chart showing the sentencing patterns for each judge included a tiny amount of cases as “No punishment,” almost as an afterthought. When the story and chart was printed, the judges howled in complaint, saying the Herald was accusing them of breaking a state law that required that anyone convicted of drunk driving be punished.</simpara><simpara>So the reporters went back to Clerk of the Court’s office that had produced the data file and asked what had caused this error. They were told that the cases in question involved indigent defendants with first-time arrests. Normally they would be given a fine, but they had no money. So the judges were sentencing them to community service, such as cleaning litter along the roads. As it turned out, the law requiring punishment had been passed after the database structure had been created. So all the court clerks knew that in the data, zeros in each of the prison-jail-fine variables meant community service. However, this <emphasis>wasn’t</emphasis> noted in the data dictionary, and therefore caused a Herald correction to be written.</simpara><simpara>The lesson in this case is to always ask the agency giving you data if there are any undocumented elements in the data, whether it is newly created codes that haven’t been included in the data dictionary, changes in the file layout, or anything else. Also, always examine the results of your analysis and ask “Does this make sense?” The Herald reporters were building the chart on deadline and were so focused on the average punishment levels of each judge that they failed to pay attention to the scant few cases that seemed to show no punishment. They should have asked themselves if it made sense that all the judges seemed to be violating state law, even if only to a tiny degree.</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>Steve Doig,  Walter Cronkite School of Journalism, Arizona State University</emphasis></simpara><?dbfo-need height="2in"?><sidebar><title>Mixed Up, Hidden and Absent Data</title><simpara>I remember a funny situation where we tried to access the Hungarian data on EU farm subsidies: it was all there—but in an excessively heavy PDF document and mixed up with data on national farm subsidies.

You should almost be able to read the story without having to know that it comes from a dataset. Make it exciting and remember who your audience is as you go.</simpara><simpara>One example of this can be found in a project carried out by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism using the EU Commission’s <ulink url="http://bit.ly/ec-fts">Financial Transparency System</ulink>. The story was constructed by approaching the dataset with specific queries in mind.</simpara><simpara>We looked through the data for key terms like “cocktail,” “golf,” and “away days.” This allowed us to determine what the Commission had spent on these items and raised plenty of questions and storylines to follow up.</simpara><simpara>But key terms don’t always give you what you want—sometimes you have to sit back and think about what you’re really asking for. During this project we also wanted to find out how much commissioners spent on private jet travel but as the dataset didn’t contain the phrase “private jet” we had to get the name of their travel providers by other means. Once we knew the name of the service provider to the Commission, “Abelag,” we were able to query the data to find out how much was being spent on services provided by Abelag.</simpara><simpara>With this approach, we had a clearly defined objective in querying the data—to find a figure that would provide a headline; the color followed.</simpara><simpara>Another approach is to start with a blacklist and look for exclusions. An easy way to pull storylines from data is to know what you shouldn’t find in there! A good example of how this can work is illustrated by the collaborative EU Structural Funds project between the Financial Times and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.</simpara><simpara>We queried the data, based on the Commission’s own rules about what kinds of companies and associations should be prohibited from receiving structural funds. One example was expenditure on tobacco and tobacco producers.</simpara><simpara>By querying the data with the names of tobacco companies, producers, and growers, we found data that revealed that British American Tobacco was receiving €1.5m for a factory in Germany.</simpara><simpara>As the funding was outside the rules of Commission expenditure, it was a quick way to find a story in the data.</simpara><simpara>You never know what you might find in a dataset, so just have a look.

That is the sound of your data decompressing from its airtight wrapper. Now what? What do you look for? And what tools do you use to get stuck in? We asked data journalists to tell us a bit about how they work with data. Here is what they said:</simpara><blockquote><attribution>
Lisa Evans,
<citetitle>the Guardian</citetitle>
</attribution><simpara>At the Guardian Datablog, we really like to interact with our readers and allowing them to replicate our data journalism quickly means they can build on the work we do and sometimes spot things we haven’t. So the more intuitive the data tools, the better. We try to pick tools that anyone could get the hang of without learning a programming language or having special training and without a hefty fee attached.</simpara><simpara>We’re currently using Google products quite heavily for this reason. All the datasets we tidy and release are available as a Google Spreadsheet, which means people with a Google account can download the data, import it into their own account and make their own charts, sort the data and create pivot tables, or they can import the data into a tool of their choice.</simpara><simpara>To map data, we use Google Fusion tables. When we create heat maps in Fusion, we share our KML shape files so that readers can download and build their own heat maps—maybe adding extra layers of data onto the Datablog’s original map. The other nice feature of these Google tools is that they work on the many platforms our readers use to access the blog, such as their desktop, their mobile, and tablets.</simpara><simpara>In addition to Google Spreadsheets and Fusion, we use two other tools in our daily work. The first is Tableau, to visualize multi-dimensional datasets; and the second is ManyEyes, for quick analysis of data. None of these tools are perfect, so we continue to look for better visualization tools that our readers will enjoy.</simpara></blockquote><blockquote><attribution>
Cynthia O’Murchu,
<citetitle>Financial Times</citetitle>
</attribution><simpara>Am I ever going to be a coder? Very unlikely! I certainly don’t think that all reporters need to know how to code. But I do think it is very valuable for them to have a more general awareness of what is possible and know how to talk to coders.</simpara><simpara>If you’re starting out, walk, don’t run. You need to persuade your colleagues and editors that working with data can get you stories that you wouldn’t otherwise get and that it’s well worth doing. Once they see the value of this approach, you can expand into doing more complex stories and projects.</simpara><simpara>My advice is to learn Excel and do some simple stories first. Start out small and work your way up to database analysis and mapping. You can do so much in Excel—it’s an extremely powerful tool and most people don’t even use a fraction of its functionality. If you can, go on a course on Excel for journalists, such as the one offered by the Centre for Investigative Journalism.</simpara><simpara>With respect to interpreting data: don’t take this lightly. You have to be conscientious. Pay attention to detail and question your results. Keep notes on how you’re processing the data and keep a copy of the original data. It is easy to make a mistake. I always do my analysis two or three times practically from scratch. Even better would be to get your editor or someone else to analyze the data separately and compare the results.</simpara></blockquote><blockquote><attribution>
Scott Klein,
<citetitle>ProPublica</citetitle>
</attribution><simpara>The ability to write and deploy complex software as quickly as a reporter can write a story is a pretty new thing. It used to take a lot longer. Things changed thanks to the development of two free/open source rapid development frameworks: Django and Ruby on Rails, both of which were first released in the mid-2000s.</simpara><simpara>Django, which is built on top of the Python programming language, was developed by Adrian Holovaty and a team working in a newsroom—the Lawrence Journal-World in Lawrence, Kansas. Ruby on Rails was developed in Chicago by by David Heinemeier Hansson and 37Signals, a web application company.</simpara><simpara>Though the two frameworks take different approaches to the “MVC pattern,” they’re both excellent and make it possible to build even very complex web applications very quickly. They take away some of the rudimentary work of building an app. Things like creating and fetching items from the database, and matching URLs to specific code in an app are built into the frameworks, so developers don’t need to write code to do basic things like that.</simpara><simpara>While there hasn’t been a formal survey of news app teams in the U.S., it is generally understood that most teams use one of these two frameworks for database-backed news apps. At ProPublica, we use Ruby on Rails.</simpara><simpara>The development of rapid web server “slice” provisioning services like Amazon Web Services also took away some of what used to make deploying a web app a slow process.</simpara><simpara>Apart from that, we use pretty standard tools to work with data: Google Refine and Microsoft Excel to clean data; SPSS and R to do statistics; ArcGIS and QGIS to do GIS; Git for source code management; TextMate, Vim and Sublime Text for writing code; and a mix of MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQL Server for databases. We built our own JavaScript framework called “Glass” that helps us build front-end heavy apps in JavaScript very quickly.</simpara></blockquote><blockquote><attribution>
Cheryl Phillips,

</attribution><simpara>Sometimes the best tool can be the simplest tool—the power of a spreadsheet is easy to underestimate. But using a spreadsheet back when everything was in DOS enabled me to understand a complex formula for the partnership agreement for the owners of The Texas Rangers—back when George W. Bush was one of the key owners. A spreadsheet can help me flag outliers or mistakes in calculations. I can write clean-up scripts and more. It is a basic in the toolbox for a data journalist.</simpara><simpara>That said, my favorite tools have even more power—SPSS for statistical analysis and mapping programs that enable me to see patterns geographically.</simpara></blockquote><blockquote><attribution>
Gregor Aisch,
<citetitle>Open Knowledge Foundation</citetitle>
</attribution><simpara>I’m a big fan of Python. Python is a wonderful open source programming language that is easy to read and write (e.g., you don’t have to type a semi-colon after each line). More importantly, Python has a tremendous user base and therefore has plugins (called packages) for literally everything you need.</simpara><simpara>I would consider Django as something rarely needed by data journalists. It is a Python web application framework—that is, a tool to create big, database-driven web applications. It is definitely too heavyweight for small interactive infographics.</simpara><simpara>I also use QGis, which is an open source toolkit providing a wide range of GIS functionality needed by data journalists who deal with geodata every now and then. If you need to convert geospatial data from one format into another, then QGis is what you need. It can handle nearly every geodata format out there (Shapefiles, KML, GeoJSON, etc.). If you need to cut out a few regions, QGis can do this as well. Plus there is a huge community around QGis, so you find tons of resources like <ulink url="http://bit.ly/goettingen-tutorial">tutorials</ulink> out in the web.</simpara><simpara>R was created mainly as a scientific visualization tool. It is hard to find any visualization method or data wrangling technique that is not already built into R. R is a universe in its own, the mecca of visual data analysis. One drawback is that you need to learn (yet another) programming language, as R has its own language. But once you have taken the initial climb on the learning curve, there’s no tool more powerful than R. Trained data journalists can use R to analyze huge datasets that extend the limits of Excel (for instance, if you have a table with a million rows).</simpara><simpara>What’s really nice about R is that you’re able to keep an exact “protocol” of what you’re doing with the data throughout the entire process—from reading a CSV file to generating charts. If the data changes, you can regenerate the chart using one click. If someone is curious about the integrity of your chart, you can show the exact source, which allows everyone to recreate the exact chart on their own (or maybe find the mistakes you made).</simpara><simpara>NumPy + MatPlotLib is kind of a way of doing the same thing in Python. It’s an option if you’re already well trained in Python. In fact, NumPy and MatPlotLib are two examples of Python packages. They can be used for data analysis and data visualization, and are both limited to static visualizations. They cannot be used to create interactive charts with tooltips and more advanced stuff.</simpara><simpara>I’m not using MapBox, but I’ve heard it is a great tool if you want to provide more sophisticated maps based on OpenStreetMap. It allows you, for instance, to customize the map styles (colors, labels, etc). There’s also a companion of MapBox, called Leaflet. Leaflet is basically a higher level JavaScript library for mapping that allows you to easily switch between map providers (OSM, MapBox, Google Maps, Bing, etc.).</simpara><simpara>RaphaelJS is a rather low-level visualization library that allows you to work with basic primitives (like circles, lines, text), and to animate them, add interactions, etc. There’s nothing like a ready-to-use bar chart in it, so you have to draw a set of rectangles yourself.</simpara><simpara>However, the good thing about Raphael is that everything you create will also work in Internet Explorer. That’s not the case with many other (amazing) visualization libraries like d3. Sadly, so many users are still using IE and no newsroom can afford to ignore 30% of their users.</simpara><simpara>Besides RaphaelJS, there’s also the option of creating a Flash fallback for IE. That is basically what The New York Times is doing. This means that you have to develop each application twice.</simpara><simpara>I’m still not convinced about the “best” process of shipping visualization for IE and modern browsers. Often I find that RaphaelJS applications can run horribly slow on IE, around ten times slower than they run in Flash using modern browsers. So Flash fallbacks might be a better option if you want to provide high-quality animated visualizations for all users.</simpara></blockquote><blockquote><attribution>
Steve Doig,
<citetitle>Walter Cronkite School of Journalism</citetitle>
</attribution><simpara>My go-to tool is Excel, which can handle the majority of CAR problems and has the advantages of being easy to learn and available to most reporters. When I need to merge tables, I typically use Access, but then export the merged table back into Excel for further work. I use ESRI’s ArcMap for geographic analyses; it’s powerful and is used by the agencies that gather geocoded data. TextWrangler is great for examining text data with quirky layouts and delimiters, and can do sophisticated search-and-replace with regular expressions. When statistical techniques like linear regression are needed, I use SPSS; it has a friendly point-and-click menu. For really heavy lifting, like working with datasets that have millions of records that may need serious filtering and programmed variable transformations, I use SAS software.</simpara></blockquote><blockquote><attribution>

</attribution><simpara>Visualization is critical to data analysis. It provides a front line of attack, revealing intricate structure in data that cannot be absorbed in any other way. We discover unimagined effects, and we challenge imagined ones.</simpara></blockquote><simpara>Data by itself, consisting of bits and bytes stored in a file on a computer hard drive, is invisible. In order to be able to see and make any sense of data, we need to visualize it. In this section I’m going to use a broader understanding of the term <emphasis>visualizing</emphasis>, that includes even pure textual representations of data. For instance, just loading a dataset into a spreadsheet software can be considered as data visualization. The invisible data suddenly turns into a visible “picture” on our screen. Thus, the question should not be whether journalists need to visualize data or not, but which kind of visualization may be the most useful in which situation.</simpara><simpara>In other words: when does it makes sense to go beyond the table visualization? The short answer is: <emphasis>almost always</emphasis>. Tables alone are definitely not sufficient to give us an overview of a dataset. And tables alone don’t allow us to immediately identify patterns within the data. The most common example here are geographical patterns that can only be observed after visualizing data on a map. But there are also other kinds of patterns, which we will see later in this section.</simpara><sect2 id="_using_visualization_to_discover_insights"><title>Using Visualization to Discover Insights</title><simpara>It is unrealistic to expect that data visualization tools and techniques will unleash a barrage of ready-made stories from datasets.

They show labels and amounts in the most structured and organized fashion and reveal their full potential when combined with the ability to sort and filter the data. Additionally, Edward Tufte suggested including small chart pieces within table columns—for instance, one bar per row or a small line chart (since then also known as a sparkline). But still, as mentioned earlier, tables clearly have their limitations. They are great to show you one-dimensional outliers like the top 10, but they are poor when it comes to comparing multiple dimensions at the same time (for instance, population per country over time).</simpara><figure id="FIG055" float="none"><title>Tips from Tufte: sparklines (Gregor Aisch)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 5 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0505.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0505.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><simpara>Charts, in general, allow you to map dimensions in your data to visual properties of geometric shapes. There’s much written about the effectiveness of individual visual properties, and the short version is this: color is difficult, position is everything. In a scatterplot, for instance, two dimensions are mapped to the to the x- and y-position. You can even display a third dimension to the color or size of the displayed symbols. Line charts are especially suited for showing temporal evolutions, while bar charts are perfect for comparing categorical data. You can stack chart elements on top of each other. If you want to compare a small number of groups in your data, displaying multiple instances of the same chart is a very powerful way (also referred to as small multiples). In all charts you can use different kinds of scales to explore different aspects in your data (e.g., linear or log scale).</simpara><simpara>In fact, most of the data we’re dealing with is somehow related to actual people. The power of maps is to reconnect the data to our very physical world. Imagine a dataset of geolocated crime incidents. Crucially, you want to see <emphasis>where</emphasis> the crimes happen. Also maps can reveal geographic relations within the data (e.g., a trend from North to South, or from urban to rural areas).</simpara><figure id="FIG056" float="none"><title>Choropleth map (Gregor Aisch)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 6 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0506.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0506.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><simpara>Speaking of relations, the fourth most important type of visualization is a graph. Graphs are all about showing the interconnections (edges) in your data points (nodes). The position of the nodes is then calculated by more or less complex graph layout algorithms which allow us to immediately see the structure within the network. The trick of graph visualization in general is to find a proper way to model the network itself. Not all datasets already include relations, and even if they do, it might not be the most interesting aspect to look at. Sometimes it’s up to the journalist to define edges between nodes. A perfect example of this is the <ulink url="http://slate.me/senate-social">U.S. Senate Social Graph</ulink>, whose edges connect senators that voted the same in more than 65% of the votes.</simpara><remark>Image commented out until permission obtained

Further investigation reveals that these huge contributions are coming from the “Obama Victory Fund 2012” (also known as Super PAC) and were made on June 29th ($450k), September 29th ($1.5mio), and December 30th ($1.9mio).</simpara><figure id="FIG0510" float="none"><title>Three clear outliers (Gregor Aisch)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 8 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0508.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0508.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><simpara>While the contributions by Super PACs alone is undoubtedly the biggest story in the data, it might be also interesting to look beyond it.

The $30,800 refunded to Cynthia Murphy equals the maximum amount individuals may give to national party committees per year. Maybe she just wanted to combine both donations in one transaction, which was rejected.

The interesting thing about the line is that donations by individuals were limited to $2500. Consequently, every dollar above that limit was refunded to the donors, which results in the second line pattern at -$2500.

In Argentina there is no Freedom of Information Act and no national data portal, so we feel strongly about providing our readers with access to the data that we use in our stories.</simpara><simpara>Hence we publish raw structured data through our integrated <ulink url="http://data.lanacion.com.ar">Junar</ulink> platform as well as in Google Spreadsheets. We explicitly enable and encourage others to reuse our data, and we explain a bit about how to do this with <ulink url="http://bit.ly/lanacion-tutorials">documentation and video tutorials</ulink>.</simpara><simpara>Furthermore, we’re presenting some of these datasets and visualizations in our <ulink url="http://blogs.lanacion.com.ar/data/">Nación Data blog</ulink>.

While many of us think about data as disassociated, free-floating numbers, they are in fact measurements of tangible (and very often human) things. Data are tethered to the real lives of real people, and when we engage with the numbers, we must consider the real-world systems from which they came.</simpara><simpara>Take, for example, location data, which is being collected right now on hundreds of millions of phones and mobile devices. It’s easy to think of these data (numbers that represent latitude, longitude, and time) as “digital exhaust,” but they are in fact distilled moments from our personal narratives. While they may seem dry and clinical when read in a spreadsheet, when we allow people to put their own data on a map and replay them, they experience a kind of memory replay that is powerful and human.</simpara><?dbfo-need height="2in"?><simpara>At the moment, location data is used by a lot of third parties—application developers, big brands, and advertisers. While the second parties (telecoms and device managers) own and hold the data, the first party in this equation—you—has neither access or control over this information. At the NYTimes R&amp;D group, we have launched a prototype project called OpenPaths (<ulink url="https://openpaths.cc">https://openpaths.cc</ulink>) to both allow the public to explore their own location data, and to experience the concept of data ownership. After all, people should have control of these numbers that are so closely connected to their own lives and experiences.</simpara><simpara>Journalists have a very important role in bringing this inherent humanity of data to light. By doing so, they have the power to change public understanding—both of data and of the systems from which the numbers emerged.</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>Jer Thorp, Data Artist in Residence: New York Times R&amp;D Group</emphasis></simpara></sect2><sect2 id="_open_data_open_source_open_news"><title>Open Data, Open Source, Open News</title><simpara>2012 may well be the year of open news. It’s at the heart of our editorial ideology and a key message in our current branding. Amidst all this, it’s clear that we need an open process for data-driven journalism. This process must not only be fuelled by open data, but also be enabled by open tools. By the end of the year, we hope to be able to accompany every visualization we publish with access to both the data behind it and the code that powers it.</simpara><simpara>Many of the tools used in visualization today are closed source. Others come with restrictive licenses that prohibit the use of derivative data. The open source libraries that do exist often solve a single problem well but fail to offer a wider methodology. All together, this makes it difficult for people to build on each other’s work. It closes conversations rather than them opening up. To this end, we are developing a stack of open tools for interactive storytelling—the Miso Project (@themisoproject).</simpara><simpara>We are discussing this work with a number of other media organizations. It takes community engagement to realize the full potential of open source software. If we’re successful, it will introduce a fundamentally different dynamic with our readers.

They might be searchable databases, sleek visualizations, or something else altogether. But no matter what form they take, news apps encourage readers to interact with data in a context that is meaningful to them: looking up crime trends in their area, checking the safety records of their local doctor, or searching political contributions to their candidate of choice.</simpara><simpara>More than just high-tech infographics, the best news apps are durable products. They live outside the news cycle, often by helping readers solve real-world problems, or answering questions in such a useful or novel way that they become enduring resources. When journalists at ProPublica wanted to explore the safety of American kidney dialysis clinics, they built <ulink url="http://projects.propublica.org/dialysis/">an application</ulink> that helped users check whether their hometown facility was safe. Providing such an important and relevant service creates a relationship with users that reaches far beyond what a narrative story can do alone.</simpara><simpara>Therein lies both the challenge and the promise of building cutting-edge news apps: creating something of lasting value.  Whether you are a developer or a manager, any discussion about how to build a great news app should start with a product development mentality: keep a laser focus on the user, and work to get the most bang for your buck. So before you start building, it helps to ask yourself three questions, discussed in the following sections.</simpara><figure id="FIG062" float="none"><title>Dialysis Facility Tracker (ProPublica)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 1 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0601.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0601.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><sect2 id="_who_is_my_audience_and_what_are_their_needs"><title>Who Is My Audience and What Are Their Needs?</title><simpara>News apps don’t serve the story for its own sake—they serve the user. Depending on the project, that user might be a dialysis patient who wants to know about the safety record of her clinic, or even a homeowner unaware of earthquake hazards near his home. No matter who it is, any discussion about building a news app, like any good product, should start with the people who are going to use it.</simpara><simpara>A single app might serve many users. For instance, a project called <ulink url="http://curbwise.com/">Curbwise</ulink>, built by the Omaha (Nebraska) World-Herald serves homeowners who believe they are being overtaxed; curious residents who are interested in nearby property values; and real estate workers trying to keep track of recent sales. In each of those cases, the app meets a specific need that keeps users coming back.</simpara><simpara>Homeowners, for instance, might need help gathering information on nearby properties so they can argue that their taxes are unfairly high. Pulling together that information is time-consuming and complicated, a problem Curbwise solves for its users by compiling a <ulink url="http://curbwise.com/how-to-protest">user-friendly report</ulink> of all the information they need to challenge their property taxes to local authorities. Curbwise sells that report for $20, and people pay for it because it solves a real problem in their lives.</simpara><simpara>Whether your app solves a real-world problem like Curbwise or supplements the narrative of a story with an interesting visualization, always be aware of the people who will be using it. Concentrate on designing and building features based on their needs.</simpara></sect2><sect2 id="_how_much_time_should_i_spend_on_this"><title>How Much Time Should I Spend on This?</title><simpara>Developers in the newsroom are like water in the desert: highly sought-after and in short supply. Building news apps means balancing the daily needs of a newsroom against the long-term commitments it takes to build truly great products.</simpara><simpara>Say your editor comes to you with an idea: the City Council is set to have a vote next week about whether to demolish several historic properties in your town. He suggests building a simple application that allows users to see the buildings on a map.</simpara><simpara>As a developer, you have a few options. You can flex your engineering muscle by building a gorgeous map using custom software. Or you can use existing tools like Google Fusion Tables or open source mapping libraries and finish the job in a couple hours. The first option will give you a better app; but the second might give you more time to build something else with a better chance of having a lasting impact.</simpara><simpara>Just because a story lends itself to a complex, beautiful news app doesn’t mean you need to build one. Balancing priorities is critical. The trick is to remember that every app you build comes at a cost: namely, another potentially more impactful app you could have been working on instead.</simpara></sect2><sect2 id="_how_can_i_take_things_to_the_next_level"><title>How Can I Take Things to the Next Level?</title><simpara>Building high-end news apps can be time-consuming and expensive. That’s why it always pays to ask about the payoff. How do you elevate a one-hit wonder into something special?</simpara><simpara>Creating an enduring project that transcends the news cycle is one way. But so is building a tool that saves you time down the road (and open sourcing it!), or applying advanced analytics to your app to learn more about your audience.</simpara><simpara>Lots of organizations build Census maps to show demographic shifts in their cities. But when the Chicago Tribune news apps team <ulink url="http://bit.ly/chicago-census">built theirs</ulink>, they took things to the next level by developing tools and techniques to build those maps quickly, which they then <ulink url="http://bit.ly/chicagotribune-maps">made available</ulink> for other organizations to use.</simpara><simpara>At my employer, the Center for Investigative Reporting, we coupled a simple searchable database with a fine-grained event tracking framework that allowed us to learn, among other things, how much users value serendipity and exploration in our news apps.</simpara><simpara>At the risk of sounding like a bean-counter, always think about <ulink url="http://bit.ly/cironline-return">return on investment</ulink>. Solve a generic problem; create a new way to engage users; open source parts of your work; use analytics to learn more about your users; or even find cases like Curbwise where part of your app might generate revenue.</simpara></sect2><sect2 id="_wrapping_up"><title>Wrapping Up</title><simpara>News application development has come a long way in a very short time. News Apps 1.0 were a lot like Infographics 2.0—interactive data visualizations, mixed with searchable databases, designed primarily to advance the narrative of the story. Now, many of those apps can be designed by reporters on deadline using open source tools, freeing up developers to think bigger thoughts.</simpara><simpara>News Apps 2.0, where the industry is headed, is about combining the storytelling and public service strengths of journalism with the product development discipline and expertise of the technology world. The result, no doubt, will be an explosion of innovation around ways to make data relevant, interesting and especially useful to our audience—and at the same time, hopefully helping journalism do the same.</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>Chase Davis, Center for Investigative Reporting</emphasis></simpara></sect2></sect1><sect1 id="_news_apps_at_propublica"><title>News Apps at ProPublica</title><simpara>A news application is a big interactive database that tells a news story. Think of it like you would any other piece of journalism. It just uses software instead of words and pictures.</simpara><simpara>By showing each reader data that is specific to them, a news app can help each reader understand a story in a way that’s personally meaningful to them. It can help a reader understand their personal connection to a broad national phenomenon, and help them attach what they know to what they don’t know, and thereby encourage a deep understanding of abstract concepts.</simpara><simpara>We tend to build news apps when we have a dataset (or think we can acquire a dataset) that is national in scope yet granular enough to expose meaningful details.</simpara><simpara>A news app should tell a story, and just like any good news story, it needs a headline, a byline, a lead, and a nut graph. Some of these concepts can be hard to distinguish in a piece of interactive software, but they’re there if you look closely.</simpara><simpara>Also, a news app should be generative, meaning it should generate more stories and more reporting. ProPublica’s best apps have been used as the basis for local stories.</simpara><simpara>For instance, take our <ulink url="http://projects.propublica.org/docdollars">Dollars for Docs news app</ulink>. It tracked, for the first time, millions of dollars of payments by drug companies to doctors, for consulting, speaking, and so on. The news app we built lets readers look up their own doctor and see the payments they’ve received. Reporters at other news organizations also used the data. More than 125 local news organizations, including the Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch did investigative stories on local doctors based on Dollars for Docs data.</simpara><simpara>A few of these local stories were the result of formal partnerships, but the majority were done quite independently—in some cases, we didn’t have much, if any, knowledge that the story was being worked on until it came out. As a small but national news organization, this kind of thing is crucial for us. We can’t have local knowledge in 125 cities, but if our data can help reporters who have local knowledge tell stories with impact, we’re fulfilling our mission.</simpara><simpara>One of my favorite news apps is the Los Angeles Times’s <ulink url="http://projects.latimes.com/mapping-la/neighborhoods/">Mapping L.A.</ulink>, which started out as a crowdsourced map of Los Angeles’s many neighborhoods, which up until Mapping L.A. launched, had no independent, widely-accepted set of boundaries. After the initial crowdsourcing project, the Times has been able to use neighborhoods as a framing device for great data reporting—things like crime rate by neighborhood, school quality by neighborhood, etc., which they wouldn’t have been able to do before. So not only is Mapping L.A. both broad and specific, it’s generative, and it tells people’s own stories.</simpara><simpara>The resources necessary to build a news app range pretty widely. The New York Times has dozens of people working on news apps and on interactive graphics. But <ulink url="http://polltracker.talkingpointsmemo.com/">Talking Points Memo</ulink> made a cutting edge political poll tracker app with two staffers, neither of whom had computer science degrees.</simpara><simpara>Like most newsroom-based coders, we follow a modified Agile methodology to build our apps. We iterate quickly and show drafts to the other folks in the newsroom we’re working with. Most importantly, we work really closely with reporters and read their drafts—even early ones. We work much more like reporters than like traditional programmers. In addition to writing code, we call sources, gather information, and build expertise. It would be pretty difficult to make a good news app using material we don’t understand.</simpara><simpara>Why should newsrooms be interested in producing data-driven news apps? Three reasons: It’s great journalism, it’s hugely popular—ProPublica’s most popular features are news apps—and if we don’t do it, somebody else will. Think of all the scoops we’d miss! Most importantly, newsrooms should know that they can all do this too. It’s easier than it looks.</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>Scott Klein, ProPublica</emphasis></simpara></sect1><sect1 id="_visualization_as_the_workhorse_of_data_journalism"><title>Visualization as the Workhorse of Data Journalism</title><simpara>Before you launch into trying to chart or map your data, take a minute to think about the many roles that static and interactive graphic elements play in your journalism.</simpara><simpara>In the reporting phase, visualizations can:</simpara><itemizedlist><listitem><simpara>

Don’t consider it a separate step, something to be considered after the story is largely written. Let this work help guide your reporting.</simpara><simpara>Getting started sometimes means just putting the notes you’ve already taken in a visual form. Consider the graphic in <xref linkend="FIG064"/>, which ran in the Washington Post in 2006.</simpara><figure id="FIG064" float="none"><title>Farm Subsidies Over Time (Washington Post)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 2 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0602.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0602.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><simpara>It shows the portion of farm income associated with subsidies and key events over the past 45 years, and was built over a series of months.

It also meant that one chore was pretty much finished before the stories were written.</simpara><simpara>Here are some tips for using visualization to start exploring your datasets.</simpara><sect2 id="_tip_1_use_small_multiples_to_quickly_orient_yourself_in_a_large_dataset"><title>Tip 1: Use small multiples to quickly orient yourself in a large dataset</title><simpara>I used this technique at the Washington Post when we were looking into a tip that the George W.

The problem: yes, there was a spike in the six months before the presidential election in several of these programs—the red dots with the peak numbers next to them—but it’s the wrong election year. The pattern consistently showed up during the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and George W.

You now see them everywhere, from the little graphs under stock market quotations to win-loss records in sports.</simpara></sect2><sect2 id="_tip_2_look_at_your_data_upside_down_and_sideways"><title>Tip 2: Look at your data upside down and sideways</title><simpara>When you’re trying to understand a story or a dataset, there’s no wrong way to look at it; try it every way you can think of, and you’ll get a different perspective. If you’re reporting on crime, you might look at one set of charts with change in violent crimes in a year; another might be the percent change; the other might be a comparison to other cities; and another might be a change over time. Use raw numbers, percentages, and indexes.</simpara><simpara>Look at them on different scales. Try following the rule that the x-axis must be zero. Then break that rule and see if you learn more. Try out logarithms and square roots for data with odd distributions.</simpara><simpara>Keep in mind the research done on visual perception. William Cleveland’s experiments showed that the eye sees change in an image when the average slope is about 45 degrees. This suggests you ignore the admonitions to always start at zero and instead work toward the most insightful graphic.  Other research in epidemiology has suggested you find a target level as a boundary for your chart.  Each of these ways helps you see the data in different ways. When they’ve stopped telling you anything new, you know you’re done.</simpara></sect2><sect2 id="_tip_3_don_8217_t_assume"><title>Tip 3: Don’t assume</title><simpara>Now that you’ve looked at your data a variety of ways, you’ve probably found records that don’t seem right—you may not understand what they meant in the first place, or there are some outliers that seem like they are typos, or there are trends that seem backwards.</simpara><simpara>If you want to publish anything based on your early exploration or in a published visualization, you have to resolve these questions and you can’t make assumptions. They’re either interesting stories or mistakes; interesting challenges to common wisdom or misunderstanding.</simpara><simpara>It’s not unusual for local governments to provide spreadsheets filled with errors, and it’s also easy to misunderstand government jargon in a dataset.</simpara><simpara>First, walk back your own work. Have you read the documentation, its caveats and does the problem exist in the original version of the data? If everything on your end seems right, then it’s time to pick up the phone. You’re going to have to get it resolved if you plan to use it, so you might as well get started now.</simpara><simpara>That said, not every mistake is important. In campaign finance records, it’s common to have several hundred postal codes that don’t exist in a database of 100,000 records. As long as they’re not all in the same city or within a candidate, the occasional bad data record just doesn’t matter.</simpara><simpara>The question to ask yourself is: if I were to use this, would readers have a fundamentally accurate view of what the data says?</simpara></sect2><sect2 id="_tip_4_avoid_obsessing_over_precision"><title>Tip 4: Avoid obsessing over precision</title><simpara>The flip side of not asking enough questions is obsessing over precision before it matters.  Your exploratory graphics should be generally correct, but don’t worry if you have various levels of rounding, if they don’t add up to exactly 100 percent or if you are missing one or two years’ data out of 20. This is part of the exploration process. You’ll still see the big trends and know what you have to collect before it’s time for publication.</simpara><simpara>In fact, you might consider taking away labeling and scale markers, much like the charts above, to even better get an overall sense of the data.</simpara></sect2><sect2 id="_tip_5_create_chronologies_of_cases_and_events"><title>Tip 5: Create chronologies of cases and events</title><simpara>At the start of any complex story, begin building chronologies of key events and cases.

  There’s no hiding in an interactive graphic. If you are really going to have your readers explore the data any way they want, then every data element has to be what it claims to be. Users can find any error at any time, and it could haunt you for months or years. If you’re building your own database, it means you should expect to proofread, fact check, and copyedit the entire database. If you’re using government records, you should decide how much spot-checking you’ll do, and what you plan to do when you find the inevitable error.

Design for two types of readers

  The graphic—whether it’s a standalone interactive feature or a static visualization that goes with your story—should satisfy two different kinds of readers. It should be easy to understand at a glance, but complex enough to offer something interesting to people who want to go further. If you make it interactive, make sure your readers get something more than a single number or name.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
Convey one idea, then simplify
</term><listitem><simpara>
  Make sure there is one single thing you want people to see? Decide on the overwhelming impression you want a reader to get, and make everything else disappear. In many cases, this means removing information even when the Internet allows you to provide everything. Unless your main purpose is in transparency of reporting, most of the details you collected in your timeline and chronology just aren’t very important. In a static graphic, it will be intimidating. In an interactive graphic, it will be boring.

Not only can it be strikingly beautiful and attention getting—valuable social currency for sharing and attracting readers—it also leverages a powerful cognitive advantage: fully half of the human brain is devoted to processing visual information. When you present a user with an information graphic, you are reaching them through the mind’s highest-bandwidth pathway. A well-designed data visualization can give viewers an immediate and profound impression, and cut through the clutter of a complex story to get right to the point.</simpara><simpara>But unlike other visual media—such as still photography and video—data visualization is also deeply rooted in measurable facts. While aesthetically engaging, it is less emotionally charged, more concerned with shedding light than heat. In an era of <phrase role="keep-together">narrowly-</phrase>focused media that is often tailored towards audiences with a particular point of view, data visualization (and data journalism in general) offers the tantalizing opportunity for storytelling that is above all driven by facts, not fanaticism.</simpara><simpara>Moreover, like other forms of narrative journalism, data visualization can be effective for both breaking news—quickly imparting new information like the location of an accident and the number of casualties—and for feature stories, where it can go deeper into a topic and offer a new perspective, to help you see something familiar in a completely new way.</simpara><sect2 id="_seeing_the_familiar_in_a_new_way"><title>Seeing the Familiar in a New Way</title><simpara>In fact, data visualization’s ability to test conventional wisdom is exemplified by an interactive graphic published by The New York Times in late 2009, a year after the global economic crisis began (<ulink url="http://nyti.ms/employment-lines">http://nyti.ms/employment-lines</ulink>).

We now think of this static, flat medium as a second class citizen, but in fact over the hundreds of years we’ve been writing and printing, we’ve managed to achieve an incredible wealth of knowledge and practices to represent data on the page. While interactive charts, data visualizations, and infographics are all the rage, they forego many of the best practices we’ve learned. Only when you look back through the history of accomplished charts and graphs can we understand that bank of knowledge and bring it forward into new mediums.</simpara><simpara>Some of the most famous charts and graphs came out of the need to better explain dense tables of data. William Playfair was a Scottish polyglot who lived in the late 1700s to early 1800s. He singlehandedly introduced the world to many of the same charts and graphs we still use today. In his 1786 book, <emphasis>Commercial and Political Atlas</emphasis>, Playfair introduced the bar chart to clearly show the import and export quantities of Scotland in a new and visual way.</simpara><simpara>He then went on to popularize the dreaded pie chart in his 1801 book <emphasis>Statistical Breviary</emphasis>. The need for these new forms of charts and graphs came out of commerce, but as time passed, others appeared and were used to save lives. In 1854 John Snow created his now famous “Cholera Map of London” by adding a small black bar over each address where an incident was reported. Over time, an obvious density of the outbreak could be seen and action taken to curb the problem.</simpara><simpara>As time passed, practitioners of these new chart and graphs got bolder and experimented further, pushing the medium toward what we know today. André-Michel Guerry was the first to publish the idea of a map where individual regions were different colors based on some variable. In 1829 he created the first choropleth by taking regions in France and shading them to represent crime levels. Today we see such maps used to show political polling regions, who voted for whom, wealth distribution, and many other geographically linked variables. It seems like such a simple idea, but even today, it is difficult to master and understand if not used wisely.</simpara><figure id="FIG0615" float="none"><title>An early bar chart (William Playfair)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 11 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0611.pdf" format="PDF" scale="83"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0611.png" format="PNG" scale="83"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><figure id="FIG0616" float="none"><title>Cholera map of London (John Snow)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 12 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0612.pdf" format="PDF" scale="81"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0612.png" format="PNG" scale="81"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><figure id="FIG0617" float="none"><title>Choropleth map of France showing crime levels (André-Michel Guerry)</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 13 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0613.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0613.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><simpara>There are many tools a good journalist needs to understand and have in their toolbox for constructing visualizations. Rather than jump right in at the deep end, an excellent grounding in charts and graphs is important. Everything you create needs to originate from a series of atomic charts and graphs. If you can master the basics, then you can move onto constructing more complex visualizations which are made up from these basic units.</simpara><simpara>Two of the most basic chart types are bar charts and line charts. While they are very similar in their use cases, they can also differ greatly in their meaning. Let’s take for instance, company sales for each month of the year. We’d get 12 bars representing the amount of money brought in each month (<xref linkend="FIG0618"/>).</simpara><figure id="FIG0618" float="0"><title>A simple bar chart: useful to represent discrete information</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 14 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0614.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0614.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><simpara>Let’s look into why this should be bars rather than a line graph. Line graphs are ideal for continuous data. With our sales figures, it is the sum of the month, not continuous. As a bar, we know that in January, the company made $100 and in February it made $120. If we made this a line graph, it would still represent $100 and $120 on the first of each month, but with the line graph we estimate that on the 15th it looks as it the company made $110. Which isn’t true. Bars are used for discrete units of measurement, whereas lines are used when it is a continuous value, such as temperature.</simpara><figure id="FIG0619" float="none"><title>Simple line graphs: useful to represent continuous information</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 15 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0615.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0615.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><simpara>We can see that at 8:00 the temperature was 20C and at 9:00 it was 22C. If we look at the line to guess the temperature at 8:30 we’d say 21C, which is a correct estimate since temperature is continuous and every point isn’t a sum of other values; it represents the exact value at that moment or an estimate between two exact measurements.</simpara><simpara>Both the bar and line have a stacked variation (<xref linkend="FIG0621"/>). This is an excellent storytelling tool that can work in different ways. Let’s take, for example, a company that has 3 locations.</simpara><simpara>For each month we have 3 bars, one for each of the shops—36 total for the year. When we place them next to each other (<xref linkend="FIG0620"/>), we can quickly see in which month which store was earning the most. This is one interesting and valid story, but there is another hidden within the same data. If we stack the bars, so we only have one for each month, we now lose the ability to easily see which store is the biggest earner, but now we can see which months the company does the best business as a whole.</simpara><figure id="FIG0620" float="none"><title>A grouped bar graph</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 16 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0616.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0616.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><figure id="FIG0621" float="none"><title>A stacked bar graph</title><!--Formal figure increments: number 17 --><mediaobject><imageobject role="print"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/print/djhb_0617.pdf" format="PDF"/></imageobject><imageobject role="web"><imagedata fileref="/work/eans/9781449330064/figs/web/djhb_0617.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></mediaobject></figure><simpara>Both of these are valid displays of the same information, but they are two different stories using the same starting data. As a journalist, the most important aspect of working with the data is that you first choose the story you are interested in telling. Is it which month is the best for business, or is it which store is the flagship? This is just a simple example, but it is really the whole focus of data journalism—asking the right question before getting too far. The story will guide the choice of visualization.</simpara><simpara>The bar chart and line graph are really the bread and butter of any data journalist. From there you can expand into histograms, horizon graphs, sparklines, stream graphs, and others, which all share similar properties and are suited for slightly different situations—including the amount of data or data sources, and location of the graphic in terms of the text.</simpara><simpara>In journalism, one of the very commonly used charting features is a map. Time, amount, and geography are common to maps. We always want to know how much is on one area versus another or how the data flows from one area to another. Flow diagrams and choropleths are very useful tools to have in your skill set when dealing with visualizations for journalism. Knowing how to color-code a map properly without misrepresenting or misleading readers is key. Political maps are usually color-coded as all or nothing for certain regions, even if a candidate only won one part of the country by 1%. Coloring does not have to be a binary choice; gradients of color based on groups can be used with care. Understanding maps is a large part of journalism. Maps easily answer the WHERE part of the 5 W’s.</simpara><simpara>Once you have mastered the basic type of charts and graphs, you can then begin to build-up more fancy data visualizations. If you don’t understand the basics, then you are building on a shaky foundation. In much the way you learn how to be a good writer—keeping sentences short, keeping the audience in mind, and not overcomplicating things to make yourself sound smart, but rather conveying meaning to the reader—you shouldn’t go overboard with the data either. Starting small is the most effective way to tell the story, slowly building only when needed.</simpara><blockquote><attribution>

Most of the times we do not need to, but sometimes we want to do so to help our readers. Stories containing a huge amount of data quite often need visualization. However, we have to be quite critical when choosing what kind of data we are going to present. We know all kinds of stuff when we report about something, but what does the reader really need to know for the story? Perhaps a table is enough, or a simple graph showing a development from year A to year C. When working with data journalism, the point is not necessarily to present huge amounts of data. It’s about journalism!</simpara><simpara>There has been a clear trend in the last 2-3 years to create interactive graphs and tables that enable the reader to drill down into different themes. A good visualization is like a good picture. You understand what it is about just by looking at it for a moment or two. The more you look at the visual, the more you see. The visualization is bad when the reader does not know where to start or where to stop, and when the visualization is overloaded by details. In this scenario, perhaps a piece of text would be better?</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>John Bones, Verdens Gang</emphasis></simpara></sect2></sect1><sect1 id="_public_data_goes_social"><title>Public Data Goes Social</title><simpara>Data is invaluable.

To do this, we have had to engage users across all platforms and to reach out to citizens via NGOs.

What does the Nigerian citizen care about? Where do they feel an information gap? How can we make the data relevant to their lives? BudgIT’s immediate target is the average literate Nigerian connected to online forums and social media. In order to compete for the limited attention of users immersed in a wide variety of interests (gaming, reading, socializing) we need to present the data in a brief and concise manner. After broadcasting a snapshot of the data as a Tweet or an infographic, there’s an opportunity for a more sustained engagement with a more interactive experience to give users a bigger picture.</simpara><simpara>When visualizing data, it is important to understand the level of data literacy of our users. As beautiful and sophisticated as they may be, complex diagrams and interactive applications might not meaningfully communicate to our users based on their previous experiences with interpreting data. A good visualization will speak to the user in a language they can understand, and bring forth a story that they can easily connect with.</simpara><simpara>We have engaged over 10,000 Nigerians over the budget, and we profile them into three categories to ensure that optimum value is delivered. The categories are briefly explained below:</simpara><variablelist><varlistentry><term>

Active users

Stimulating discussion around current trends
</term><listitem><simpara>
  BudgIT keeps track of online and offline discussions and seeks to provide data around these topics. For example, with the fuel strikes in January 2012, there was constant agitation among the protesters on the need to reinstate fuel subsidies and reduce extravagant and unnecessary public expenditure. BudgIT tracked the discussion via social media and in 36 busy hours, built an app that allows citizens to reorganize the Nigerian budget.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
Good feedback mechanisms
</term><listitem><simpara>
  We engage with users through discussion channels and social media. Many users want to know about stories behind the data and many ask for our opinion. We make sure that our responses only explain the facts behind the data and are not biased by our personal or political views. We need to keep feedback channels open, actively respond to comments, and engage the users creatively to ensure that the community built around the data is sustained.
</simpara></listitem></varlistentry><varlistentry><term>
Make it local
</term><listitem><simpara>
  For a dataset targeted at a particular group, BudgIT aims to localize its content and to promote a channel of discussion that connects to the needs and interests of particular groups of users. In particular, we’re interested in engaging users around issues they care about via SMS.

You’re human; you’re going to make mistakes, miss things, and get the wrong idea from time to time. Your audience is one of the most useful assets that you’ve got. They can fact-check and point out things that you may not have considered.</simpara><?dbfo-need height="1in"?><simpara>Engaging that audience is tricky, though. You’re dealing with a group of people who’ve been conditioned over years of Internet use to hop from site to site, leaving nothing but a sarcastic comment in their wake. Building a level of trust between you and your users is crucial; they need to know what they’re going to get, know how they can react to it and offer feedback, and know that that feedback is going to be listened to.</simpara><simpara>But first you need to think about what audience you’ve got, or want to get. That will both inform and be informed by the kind of data that you’re working with. If it’s specific to a particular sector, then you’re going to want to explore particular communications with that sector. Are there trade bodies that you can get in touch with that might be willing to publicize the resources that you’ve got and the work that you’ve done to a wider audience? Is there a community website or a forum that you can get in touch with? Are there specialist trade publications that may want to report on some of the stories that you’re finding in the data?</simpara><simpara>Social media is an important tool, too, though it again depends on the type of data that you’re working with. If you’re looking at global shipping statistics, for example, you’re unlikely to find a group on Facebook or Twitter that’ll be especially interested in your work. On the other hand, if you’re sifting through corruption indices across the world, or local crime statistics, that’s likely to be something that’s going to be of interest to a rather wider audience.</simpara><simpara>When it comes to Twitter, the best approach tends to be to contact high-profile figures, briefly explaining why your work is important, and including a link. With any luck, they’ll retweet you to their readers, too. That’s a great way to maximize exposure to your work with minimum effort—though don’t badger people!</simpara><simpara>Once you’ve got people on the page, you need to think about how your audience going to interact with your work. Sure, they might read the story that you’ve written and look at the infographics or maps, but giving your users an outlet to respond is immensely valuable. More than anything, it’s likely to give you greater insight into the subject you’re writing about, informing future work on the topic.</simpara><simpara>Firstly, it goes without saying that you need to publish the raw data alongside your articles. Either host the data in comma-separated plain text, or host it in a third-party service like Google Docs. That way, there’s only one version of the data around, and you can update it as necessary if you find errors in the data that need correcting later. Better still, do both. Make it as easy as possible for people to get hold of your raw materials.</simpara><simpara>Then start to think about if there’s other ways that you can get the audience to interact. Keep an eye on metrics on which parts of your datasets are getting attention—it’s likely that the most trafficked areas could have something to say that you might have missed. For example, you might not think to look at the poverty statistics in Iceland, but if those cells are getting plenty of attention, then there might be something there worth looking at.</simpara><?dbfo-need height="1in"?><simpara>Think beyond the comment box, too. Can you attach comments to particular cells in a spreadsheet? Or a particular region of an infographic? While most embeddable publishing systems don’t necessarily allow for this, it’s worth taking a look at if you’re creating something a little more bespoke. The benefits that it can bring to your data can’t be underestimated.</simpara><simpara>Make sure that other users can see those comments too—they have almost as much value as the original data, in a lot of cases, and if you keep that information to yourself, then you’re depriving your audience of that value.</simpara><simpara>Finally, other people might want to publish their own infographics and stories based on the same sources of data—think about how best to link these together and profile their work. You could use a hashtag specific to the dataset, for example, or if it’s highly pictorial, then you could share it in a Flickr group.</simpara><simpara>Having a route to share information more confidentially could be useful too—in some cases it might not be safe for people to publicly share their contributions to a dataset, or they might simply not be comfortable doing so. Those people may prefer to submit information through an email address, or even an anonymous comments box.</simpara><simpara>The most important thing you can do with your data is share it as widely and openly as possible. Enabling your readers to check your work, find your mistakes, and pick out things that you might have missed will make both your journalism—and the experience for your reader—infinitely better.</simpara><simpara>— <emphasis>Duncan Geere, Wired.co.uk</emphasis></simpara></sect1></chapter><colophon id="_colophon"><title>Colophon</title><para><remark>ignore</remark></para></colophon></book>
