=== For the Great Unnamed

The Data Journalism Handbook was born at a 48 hour workshop led by the European Journalism Centre and the Open Knowledge Foundation at MozFest 2011 in London. It subsequently spilled over into an international, collaborative effort involving dozens of data journalism&#8217;s leading advocates and best practitioners.

In the six months that passed between the book&#8217;s inception to its first full release, hundreds of people have contributed in various ways. While we have done our best to keep track of them all, we have had our fair share of anonymous, pseudonymous, and untraceable edits.

To all of those people who have contributed and are not listed below, we say two things. Firstly, thank you. Secondly, can you please tell us who you are so that we can give credit where credit is due?

=== What This Book Is (And What It Isn&#8217;t)

This book is intended to be a useful resource for anyone who thinks that they might be interested in becoming a data journalist--or just dabbling in data journalism.

Lots of people have contributed to writing it, and through our editing we have tried to let their different voices and views shine through. We hope that it reads like a rich and informative conversation about what data journalism is, why it is important, and how to do it.

Lamentably, the act of reading this book will not supply you with a comprehensive repertoire of all the knowledge and skills you need to become a data journalist. This would require a vast library manned by hundreds of experts able to answer questions on hundreds of topics. Luckily this library exists; it is called the Internet. Instead, we hope this book will give you a sense of how to get started and where to look if you want to go further. Examples and tutorials serve to be illustrative rather than exhaustive.

We count ourselves very lucky to have had so much time, energy, and patience from all of our contributors and have tried our best to use this wisely. We hope that--in addition to being a useful reference source--the book does something to document the passion and enthusiasm, the vision and energy of a nascent movement. The book attempts to give you a sense of what happens behind the scenes, the stories behind the stories.

_The Data Journalism Handbook_ is a work in progress. If you think there is anything which needs to be amended or is conspicuously absent, then please flag it for inclusion in the next version. It is also freely available under a http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike] license, and we strongly encourage you to share it with anyone that you think might be interested in reading it.
